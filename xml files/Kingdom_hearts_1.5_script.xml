(Clouds form amongst darkness as words appear on the screen. Lightning
strikes several clouds)

Disney Interactive Studios

Square Enix

Kingdom Hearts

(The clouds part and the words rush the screen. A boy awakes, floating 
in a strange abyss, the keychain around his neck waving in the current 
of wind blowing upwards. Gold letters appear in the void)

????: I've been having these weird thoughts lately... Like, is any of this 
for real or not?

(The words fade away. The boy's heart pumps as he falls deeper into the 
abyss, his eyes closed. The empty nothingness becomes water, and bubbles 
form in the wake of his descent. He reaches a barrier and his eyes blink 
open with a flash. He finds himself standing on a sandy beach on a clear 
sunny day. He looks around and sees another boy in the water. Holding his 
hand up to block the glare of the sun, he steps toward the boy in the water 
to get a closer look. Suddenly, the ocean waters recede. He looks up and 
gasps. The boy in the water, turns his head, the breeze billowing through 
his silver hair, as a wave forms beyond. He smirks, holding his hand out 
as the wave reaches its pinnacle behind him. The boy with brown hair runs 
toward the boy in the water, who isn't moving. Time seems to slow down as 
the wave crashes down on top of them. The first boy spins in the water, 
gritting his teeth. He rights himself and stares at the other boy, who is 
unfazed, saying nothing with his arm beckoning. The first boy tries to 
reach him, but is swept away with the current. He eventually surfaces, 
gasping for air, the water dripping off of him as the sun hangs low in 
the sky. He sees a girl on the shore waving to him and calling his name. 
He waves back and starts padding towards shore as she bounces happily on 
her feet. The girl stands with her hands behind her back as he arrives. He 
bends down slightly, catching his breath and smirks up at her. She giggles 
until something in the sky catches her attention, her face forming a 
serious look. He stands up and turns around. A meteor shower rains down 
from the sky, a shadowy figure among them. They stare in awe, and the 
boy realizes the figure is himself. He gasps and feels himself falling. 
He becomes the figure in the sky as he falls below the girl, reaching out 
to her. She reaches out to him until the image of her ripples in water 
reflecting the sky. The boy falls back, eyes closed, sinking deeper as 
bubbles trail him. He stirs awake and manages to right himself before 
settling onto a dark platform. He looks around and takes a step forward. 
There is a flash of blinding light as a large flock of birds rise from 
the platform, flying in all directions and scattering feathers everywhere. 
The boy shields his eyes as the wind whips at him. He watches them leave 
while the last feathers fall. The platform now depicts a girl taking a 
bite out of an apple. The boy turns around seeing no one, yet hearing a voice)

Voice: So much to do, so little time... Take your time. Don't be afraid. 
The door is still shut. Now, step forward. Can you do it?

(The boy takes a few slow steps forward. A light shines down from above 
as a large stone pedestal rises from the platform in a shower of light 
and magic. The boy turns toward it. A red shield blinks into existence, 
floating above it)

Voice: Power sleeps within you...

(Another pedestal rises from the platform, a blue staff floating above 
it. He turns around to face it)

Voice: If you give it form...

(A third pedestal appears in front of the boy, who turns toward it. A metal 
sword appears in midair)

Voice: It will give you strength.

(The boy stares ahead at all three)

Voice: Choose well.

(The boy runs over to the staff and holds it in his hands)

Voice: The power of the mystic. Inner strength. A staff of wonder and 
ruin. Is this the power you seek?

????: Yes.

(Suddenly, the staff vanished from his hand)

Voice: Your path is set.

(The boy turned around to face the other two weapons)

Voice: Now, what will you give up in exchange?

(The boy approaches the sword and holds it up)

Voice: The power of the warrior. Invincible courage. A sword of terrible 
destruction. You give up this power?

????: Yes.

(The sword disappeared)

Voice: You've chosen the power of the mystic. You've given up the power 
of the warrior. Is this the form you choose?

????: Yes.

(The three stones suddenly sink into the floor, knocking the boy back 
onto the platform. The ground rumbles and he looks around. The edges 
of the platform crumble off and the platform shatters. The boy falls 
through darkness and lands on another platform, this time depicting a 
girl in a beautiful silver ball gown. The staff appears in his hand)

Voice: You gained the power to fight.

(He slashes at the air)

Voice: All right! You've got it. Use this power to protect yourself and 
others.

(Shadows appear)

Voice: There will be times you have to fight. Keep your light burning strong.

(The boy fights off the Shadows. They fade back into the floor. One crawls 
around to his back)

Voice: Behind you!

(The boy defeats all of the Shadows. A black void appears in the center of 
the platform and he is sucked into it. He bats the darkness away and wakes 
up on a multicolored platform with three silhouettes. He sees a door near 
the platform edge and walks toward it, examining it)

????: I can't open it...

(A treasure chest appears and he opens it. He turns around and a large 
crate and barrel appear. He smashes these items and opens the door. Light 
floods out from it and he walks through, squinting his eyes through the 
bright light. He arrives on a small island bridge where three kids stand 
quietly waiting)

Voice: Hold on. The door won't open just yet. First, tell me more about 
yourself.

(The boy walks over to a girl leaning against a rope fence)

???????: What's most important to you?

????: Friendship.

???????: Is friendship such a big deal?

(The boy talks to a boy with a large blue sport ball)

?????: What do you want outta life?

????: To be strong.

?????: To be strong, huh?

(The boy walks over to a boy with a large red stick in his hand)

?????: What are you so afraid of?

????: Being indecisive.

?????: Being indecisive? Is that really so frightening?

Voice: You want friendship. You want to be strong. You're afraid of being 
indecisive. Your adventure begins in the dead of night. Your road won't 
be easy, but a rising sun awaits your journey's end.

????: Sounds good.

Voice: The day you will open the door is both far off and very near.

(There is a flash of light and the boy finds himself on a platform of a 
sleeping woman clutching a rose. He walks across the platform and is 
surrounded by Shadows. He defeats them all and a light shines down, 
producing a glowing green circle, power radiating from it. He stands on 
the green circle and his cuts and bruises heal. The light splits off 
toward the edge of the platform and stairs of stained glass appear. The 
boy runs up the stairs onto another platform depicting a woman in a 
yellow dress and a hideous monster)

Voice: The closer you get to the light, the greater your shadow becomes.

(The boy turns around and sees his shadow move after he does. The boy 
starts to back away as the shadow pulls itself from the ground)

Voice: But don't be afraid. And don't forget...

(The shadow takes on the form of Darkside as the boy runs to the edge of 
the platform, nearly falling off. He turns to face Darkside as it rises 
to its full towering height, gazing at him with eerie glowing eyes. The 
staff appears in his hand and he stares at his only option. Darkside 
summons a ball of energy and punches the floor. The boy trembles as a 
void of darkness appears in the floor, summoning several Shadows. The 
boy swallows his fear and attacks them, while dodging larger blows from 
Darkside. As it punches the ground again, the boy seizes the opportunity 
and strikes at its wrist. Catching its attention, he jumps back and the 
staff vanishes from his hand. Terror fills his face as he is left 
weaponless and Darkside slams his fist into the ground, narrowly missing 
him. Sora falls in defeat and a dark void appears under him, sucking him in)

Voice: ---But don't be afraid.

(The darkness engulfs his legs)

Voice: You hold the mightiest weapon of all.

(He starts to swim away as the darkness clenches onto him. His grasping 
hand is lost to the black abyss)

Voice: So don't forget...

(The boy lies on his back as the darkness wraps its last threads around 
his frightened eyes)

Voice: You are the one who will open the door.

(On a bright sandy beach, the sun shines warmly on the same spiky-haired 
boy, who opens his sleepy eyes and sits up. He yawns, starting to lay back 
down again, when suddenly: a girl’s face)

????: Whoa!

(The boy jumps back up and turns around, kneeling in the sand. The girl 
giggles, hovering over him)

????: Gimme a break, Kairi.

Kairi: Sora, you lazy bum. I knew that I'd find you snoozing down here.

Sora: No! This huge, black THING swallowed me up! I couldn't breathe! I 
couldn't--

(She smacks him)

Sora: Ow!

Kairi: Are you still dreaming?

Sora: It wasn't a dream! Or was it? I don't know.

(He looks off toward the ocean, seeing the clouds billow in the sky)

Sora: What was that place? So bizarre...

Kairi: Yeah, sure.

(She walks past him toward the water)

Sora: Say, Kairi, what was your hometown like? You know, where you grew up.

(Kairi stares out into the sea)

Kairi: I've told you before, I don't remember.

Sora: Nothing at all?

Kairi: Nothing.

Sora: You ever want to go back?

Kairi (thinking): Hmm. Well, I'm happy here.

Sora: Really...

Kairi: But you know... I wouldn't mind going to see it.

Sora: I'd like to see it too. Along with any other worlds out there. I 
wanna see 'em all!

Kairi (facing him): So what're we waiting for?

????: Hey!

(They turn to see a silver-haired boy carrying a log)

Riku: Aren't you guys forgetting about me? So, I guess I'm the only one 
working on the raft.

(He tosses the log to Sora, who falls over with a yelp, and walks over 
to Kairi)

Riku: And you're just as lazy as he is!

Kairi (giggling): So you noticed. Okay, we'll finish it together.

(She jumps up and down as Riku sits down next to Sora)

Kairi: I'll race you!

Sora: Huh?

Riku: What, are you kidding?

Kairi (giggling): Ready? Go!

(Sora and Riku glance at each other before leaping up and racing across 
the beach. They smile at each other as Kairi follows them, still giggling. 
Later, Sora talks to Kairi)

Kairi: So, can you gather the rest of the supplies? Sora, are you listening 
to me?

Sora: Yeah, I heard you.

Kairi: Okay, here's what you need to go find: Two Logs, One Cloth, One 
Rope. Bring everything back here. If you need help, just ask. I'm counting 
on you!

(Sora runs along the beach and finds a log, along with Wakka)

Wakka: Hey, what's happening man?

(Sora defeats Wakka in a practice battle, before picking up the cloth in 
a small treehut. He sees Selphie sitting on the dock)

Selphie: Ah, the breeze feels great!

(Sora defeats Selphie in a practice battle)

Selphie: Aww, I can’t believe I lost!

(Sora finds a coil of rope among the high boards where Tidus is practicing 
his fight swing)

Tidus: Hey, Sora! You feelin' lucky today!

(Sora defeats Tidus in a practice battle)

Tidus: Man, I’m really off today.

(Sora heads through the Seaside Shack and across the bridge to the small 
island, where he finds Riku and another log. Sora battles Riku, but loses)

Sora: Aww, man. Now the score’s 0 to 1!

(He brings back the stuff for Kairi, who's ecstatic)

Kairi: Thanks, Sora! I found something today, too. Here, it's yours.

(She hands him a Hi-Potion)

Kairi: Tired? Want to call it a day?

Sora: Yeah, let's go home.

Kairi: Okay. It is getting late. We'll finish up tomorrow.

(After the sun begins setting, Sora, Kairi, and Riku rest on the small 
island across the bridge and stare at the ocean. Sora and Kairi sit on 
the paopu tree as Riku leans against it, his arms folded)

Sora: So, Kairi's home is out there somewhere, right?

(Sora looks over at Riku. Kairi places her hands on her knees)

Riku: Could be. We'll never know by staying here.

Sora: But how far could a raft take us?

Riku: Who knows? If we have to, we'll think of something else.

Kairi: So, suppose you get to another world. (giggle) What would you do 
there?

Riku: Well, I haven't really thought about it.

(Sora rocks back and forth on the trunk of the tree)

Riku: It's just... I've always wondered why we're here on this island. If 
there are any other worlds out there, why did we end up on this one? And 
suppose there are other worlds... Then ours is just a little piece of 
something much greater. So we could've just as easily ended up somewhere 
else, right?

Sora (laying down on the tree): I don't know.

Riku: Exactly. That's why we need to go out there and find out. Just 
sitting here won't change a thing. It's the same old stuff. So let's go.

Kairi: You've been thinking a lot lately, haven't you?

Riku: Thanks to you. If you hadn't come here, I probably would've never 
thought of any of this. Kairi, thanks.

Kairi: You're welcome.

(They start walking back to the dock. Kairi leads the way)

Riku: Sora.

(Sora turns around and catches a star-shaped fruit)

Riku: You wanted one, didn't you?

Sora: A paopu fruit...

Riku: If two people share one, their destinies become intertwined. They'll 
remain a part of each other's lives no matter what.

(Riku walks past Sora)

Riku: C'mon, I know you want to try it.

Sora: What are you talking--

(Riku laughs and Sora tosses the fruit away. They all run back to the dock 
and head for home. Meanwhile, in another world, Donald Duck the court wizard 
walks proudly through the Colonnade of Disney Castle, passing a group of 
brooms carrying buckets. Donald stops in front of two enormous double doors. 
He clears his throat and knocks on three times. A smaller door just his 
size opens and he walks through)

Donald: Good morning, Your Majesty.

(He walks down the long red carpet of the Audience Chamber toward a golden 
throne)

Donald: It's nice to see you this morn--

(He sees that the throne is empty)

Donald: What!

(Pluto walks out from behind the throne, carrying an envelope in his mouth. 
Donald opens it and reads the letter. He blinks for a second, then 
suddenly speeds back out into the Colonnade. He races across the courtyard 
to where Goofy, Captain of the Royal Knights, is sleeping)

Donald: Wake up, Goofy, wake up! This is serious!!

(Goofy continues to snore and Donald’s temper gets the better of him. He 
points his finger into the air, yelling, and summons a lightning bolt, 
which swoops down and strikes Goofy in the side, jolting him awake. He sits 
up sleepily and looks around)

Goofy: Hey there, Donald. G'morning.

Donald: We've got a problem, Goofy! But don't tell anyone...

Goofy (ignoring Donald): Queen Minnie?

Donald: Not even the queen.

Goofy: Daisy?

Donald (shaking his head furiously): No, it's top secret!

Goofy (calling over Donald's shoulder): G'morning, ladies.

Donald: What?

(Donald turns to see a cross Daisy, hands on her hips, and Queen Minnie. 
Daisy clears her throat and Donald laughs sheepishly. The next day, Sora 
returns to the island and visits the Cove. Riku stands there, waiting 
for him)

Riku: Hey, Sora. Our raft still needs a name. Let's see... How about 
Highwind? What would you call it?

Sora: Me? Well...hm... Excalibur!

Riku: Hey, how about...

Sora: The usual?

Riku: Let's do it!

(Kairi appears on the wooden bridge nearby)

Kairi: You guys at it again? All right, I'll be the judge. The usual 
rules apply. Take any route you want... First one to tag that tree and 
make it back here wins.

(A tree with a star-shaped crown stands on a large rock wall)

Sora: If I win, I'm captain! And if you win...

Riku: I get to share the paopu with Kairi.

Sora: Huh?

Riku: Deal? The winner gets to share a paopu with Kairi.

Sora: Wha... Wait a minute...

Kairi: Okay! On my count:

(Riku and Sora ready to race)

Kairi: Three! Two! One! Go!

(She slices through the air with her hand and both Sora and Riku race 
across the bridge. The two are neck and neck until one of the boards on 
the bridge collapses, sending Riku into the water. Sora takes this chance 
to run past the lookout tower and across the bridge. He runs up the hill 
towards the star tree, seeing Riku catching up to him, by jumping across 
the tops of the palm trees nearby. Sora quickly tags the tree and races 
back to the starting line. He throws a fist into the air in success)

Sora: Now the score’s 1 to 1!

Riku: Man, lighten up. It’s just a name, after all.

(Sora scowls and walks over to the makeshift raft on the other side of the 
Cove, where Kairi is standing)

Kairi (smiling): Today we collect provisions for our trip! Let’s see. Sora, 
you’re looking for... One Seagull Egg, Three Mushrooms, Two Coconuts, Three 
Fish, and fill this up with Drinking Water. But not from the ocean!

(She hands him an empty bottle)

Kairi: Bring everything back here. If you need help, just ask.

(Sora finds a mushroom behind a rock and another amongst the bushes. He 
crosses a hole in the rocky wall, where water is trickling out and fills 
up the empty bottle. He returns to the Beach and finds Selphie on the 
dock again)

Selphie: Hey, Sora. Have you heard about the legendary power of the paopu 
fruit? They say if you share it with someone you really care for, it binds 
you together forever and ever through eternity! It's so romantic. I gotta 
try it sometime.

(Sora jumps into the water and catches three fish before swimming to the 
small island where Tidus is practicing)

Tidus: I think you've gotten stronger, but odds are you're still no match 
for Riku. We took him on three-to-one last time, and he whipped us all. 
Well, I guess Kairi can always count on him.

(Sora walks across the bridge and climbs a tree to retrieve a seagull egg 
and some coconuts. He enters the Seaside Shack and walks down the stairs 
to the beach floor. He walks along the beach and sees Wakka)

Wakka: Me and Tidus, we are gonna do a little explorin' today. You know, 
to the secret place at the base of that tree. There's gotta be something 
there, ya?

(Sora enters the Secret Place and walks through an underground tunnel, 
with roots lining the walls. He reaches a room made of walled boulders 
with chalk drawings scrawled on them. The only light is from a small hole 
in the ceiling. Sora sees the last mushroom near a wooden board in the 
wall and plucks it from the ground. Behind the mushroom is an old drawing 
of Kairi and Sora that brings memories flooding back to him. He kneels on 
the ground, placing a hand on the drawing of Kairi with a soft smile. His 
mind flashes back to the two of them as 5 year olds when they drew each 
other on the walls. Sora sits, picking up a rock and begins carving. He 
stops and stares at his work. He is giving Kairi a paopu fruit. Suddenly, 
he hears a noise behind him and stands up swiftly)

Sora: Wh-who’s there?

?????: I’ve come to see the door to this world.

Sora: Huh?

?????: This world has been connected.

Sora: Wh-What are you talking about?

?????: Tied to the darkness... Soon to be completely eclipsed.

Sora: Well, whoever you are, stop freaking me out like this. Huh?

(He notices a hooded figure standing in the shadows. An X is emblazoned 
upon its chest)

Sora: Wh-Where did you come from?

?????: You do not yet know what lies beyond the door.

Sora: So, you’re from another world!

?????: There is so very much to learn. You understand so little.

Sora (glaring): Oh, yeah? Well, you’ll see. I’m gonna get out and learn 
what’s out there!

?????: A meaningless effort. One who knows nothing can understand nothing.

(Sora looks toward the board in the wall. It resembles a door, but with 
no lock or doorknob. As Sora turns back to the figure in the shadows, it 
has disappeared. With nothing left to do, he returns to the raft, where 
Kairi is leaning against the mast fiddling with something jingling in her 
hands)

Kairi: This? I’m making a necklace of thalassa shells. In the old days, 
sailors always wore thalassa shells. They were supposed to ensure a safe 
voyage. See this?

(She holds the unfinished star-shaped charm out to him)

Kairi: It’s a charm to help us find each other if we ever get separated. 
The three of us will always be together.

(She places the Wayfinder in her pocket and he presents her with the 
collected provisions)

Kairi: Thanks, Sora! I found something today, too. Here, it’s yours.

(She hands him a Hi-Potion)

Kairi: Tired? Want to call it a day?

Sora: Yeah, let’s go home.

Kairi: Okay, tomorrow’s the big day. We should rest up!

(Later during the sunset, Sora and Kairi sit at the edge of the dock)

Kairi: You know, Riku has changed.

Sora: What do you mean?

Kairi: Well...

(She grows silent)

Sora: You okay?

Kairi: Sora, let’s take the raft and go—just the two of us!

Sora: Huh?

Kairi (giggling): Just kidding.

Sora: What’s gotten into you? You’re the one that’s changed, Kairi.

Kairi: Maybe... You know, I was a little afraid at first, but now I’m ready. 
No matter where I go or what I see, I know I can always come back here.

(She turns to face him)

Kairi: Right?

Sora: Yeah, of course!

Kairi: That’s good.

(She pauses)

Kairi: Sora, don’t ever change.

Sora: Huh?

(She stands up and takes a final look over the ocean. He stares up at her)

Kairi: I just can’t wait. Once we set sail, it’ll be great.

(He follows her gaze as the sun sets. Meanwhile in the Library of Disney 
Castle, Donald reads the letter aloud to Daisy and Queen Minnie)

“Donald,
Sorry to rush off without sayin’ goodbye, but there’s big trouble brewin’. 
Not sure why, but the stars have been blinkin’ out, one by one. And that 
means disaster can’t be far behind. I hate to leave you all but I’ve gotta 
go check into it. There’s someone with a “key”—the key to our survival. So 
I need you and Goofy to find him, and stick with him. Got it? We need that 
key or we’re doomed! So go to Traverse Town and find Leon. He’ll point you 
in the right direction.

P.S.
Would ya apologize to Minnie for me? Thanks, pal.”

(The letter is signed with the King’s seal. Pluto sleeps in his bed as the 
group muses over the King’s words)

Daisy: Oh, dear! What could this mean?

Minnie: It means we’ll just have to trust the king.

Goofy: Gawrsh, I sure hope he’s all right.

Donald: Your Highness. Don’t worry. We’ll find the king and this “key.”

Minnie: Thank you, both of you.

Donald: Daisy, can you take care of the—

Daisy: Of course. You be careful, now, both of you.

Minnie: Oh, and to chronicle your travels, he will accompany you.

(She points toward the desk. Donald peers closer, seeing a small bug jumping 
on the table)

??????: Over here!

(The cricket stops jumping once he has Donald’s attention)

??????: Cricket’s the name. Jiminy Cricket, at your service.

(He bows with his top hat in his hand)

Minnie: We hope for your safe return. Please help the king.

(Donald stands at attention. Joining Minnie and Daisy, Goofy salutes him, 
before Donald yanks him out the door)

Donald: You’re coming, too!

(They walk down the stairs under the courtyard to the Gummi Ship Control 
Room. The mouse-eared lights on the wall are dim in the dark hallway. 
Donald walks ahead as Jiminy hangs on to Goofy’s helmet)

Goofy: Gawrsh, Jiminy, your world disappeared, too?

Jiminy: It was terrible. We were scattered. And as far as I can see, I’m 
the only one who made it to this castle.

Donald (sternly): Goofy?

Goofy: Oh, right... I gotcha. Ya mean, while we’re in other worlds, we can’t 
let on where we’re from. We’ve gotta protect the world border.

Donald: “Order.”

Goofy: Right. World order.

(He laughs and Donald gives a sigh. They come upon a crown-shaped doorway)

Goofy: I guess we’ll need new duds when we get there.

(They enter the Gummi Ship Control Room, walking across the tiled floor. 
The whirring of machines fills the air as giant gears spin along the walls. 
Mechanical arms hang down from the ceiling around a small orange spaceship. 
The dome of the cockpit reveals three seats. Donald walks toward a large 
golden tube and puts a hand to his mouth)

Donald: Hello up there? Donald Duck to launch crew! Anytime you’re ready.

(In a hanging control booth, Donald’s voice echoes out of the other end of 
the tube into the ears of a black-nosed chipmunk wearing an apron. Chip 
salutes and a second chipmunk, this time with a red nose, runs toward a 
control panel. Dale jumps up to turn a blue lever. Steam billows out of 
pipes in the ceiling as more gears spin on the walls. Dale leaps to the 
window and the two chipmunks watch a mechanical hand move across the room. 
The hand picks up Goofy, carrying him upside down with his arms 
outstretched. Donald, at his annoyance of being lifted the same way, 
crosses his arms and frowns. As the cockpit opens, Pluto runs into the 
room and jumps into the Gummi Ship. A light spins on the wall as an 
interstellar runway opens, lights blinking along the path. A lift moves 
the rocket ship, aiming it at the tunnel, as Daisy and Queen Minnie enter 
the room to see their departure. Donald gives Daisy a thumbs-up and a wink 
as the rockets engines start up with a shower of flames. Donald points 
forward to the tunnel)

Donald: Blast off!!

(In the tunnel, a large neon arrow blinks on, pointing downward. The shaft 
below the Gummi Ship opens, and the ship falls through it, Donald and 
Goofy screaming. The ship drops out of the world and the engine bursts on, 
sending them into space. Meanwhile, Sora sits alone in his bedroom in the 
Destiny Islands. His window is open slightly, the only light coming from 
the moon outside and his dim desk lamp. Clothes and books are piled on the 
floor as he lies on the bed, peering over at a hanging model of a wooden 
ship with a boy and a girl passenger. Sora’s thoughts drift to his earlier 
conversation with Kairi on the dock)

Kairi: I just can’t wait. Once we set sail, it’ll be great.

(Thunder rumbles softly outside, catching Sora’s attention and he gazes 
outside. In the darkness of the cloudy night sky, lightning flashes, 
striking near the small island)

Sora: A storm?

(He sits up suddenly)

Sora: Oh, no, the raft!

(Later, the wind blows through his open bedroom window, shifting the 
curtains as a voice enters his room)

Sora’s Mom: Sora, dinner’s ready. Come on down. Sora?

(The room is empty. Sora arrives at the small island, spotting a large 
orb of energy hanging low in the sky, wind swirling in it dark depths)

Sora: What’s that?

(Sora jumps onto the dock, seeing two other boats moored there)

Sora: Riku’s boat. And Kairi’s!

(He looks around warily, seeing no one. In the dim landscape a pair of 
eyes emerges from the ground. The eyes illuminated the Shadow’s body, 
its antennae wriggling as it scans its surroundings. Another appeared 
and Sora gasps in fear. He takes out his wooden sword as one of them leaps 
at him, but he blocks the strike. He tries to hit them with the sword, but 
they seem unfazed by it. It feels to Sora as if it goes right through the 
creatures. Sora realizes his only option is to run and he makes his way to 
the wooden bridge, dodging strikes from the Shadows. Everywhere he runs, 
more appear in his wake. He sees Riku standing at the small island across 
the bridge, facing the orb in the sky. He appears unmoving, as if in a 
trance)

Sora: Where’s Kairi? I thought she was with you!

Riku: The door has opened...

Sora: What?

Riku (facing Sora): The door has opened, Sora! Now we can go to the outside 
world!

Sora: What are you talking about? We’ve gotta find Kairi!

Riku (abruptly): Kairi’s coming with us!

(Sora looks shocked)

Riku: Once we step through, we might not be able to come back. We may never 
see our parents again. There’s no turning back. But this may be our only 
chance. We can’t let fear stop us! I’m not afraid of the darkness!

(He holds out a hand toward Sora)

Sora (uneasily): Riku...

(A pool of darkness forms at Riku’s feet, its tendrils licking at where he 
stands, wrapping around his impassive body. Sora rushes forward to save his 
friend, and the darkness grabs at him. He tries to reach toward Riku, but 
the weight of the darkness pulls him down. Riku’s face is unchanging as Sora 
fails to grab his hand, the darkness proving too much for him. He blacks out 
for a second before a light twinkles into existence. It starts out small, 
but soon grows into an incredible brightness. It fills Sora’s vision and he 
feels something metallic fall into his hand. He opens his eyes, nearly 
stumbling forward as the light dissipates. He stares at the large object 
in his hand. Its golden handle and silver blade shines like a sword, but 
the tip of the blade is pointed like the teeth of a key. A keychain hangs 
from the pommel of the weapon. A name whispers softly in Sora’s ear)

Voice: Keyblade... Keyblade...

(Shadows appear around him and he swung at them with the Keyblade. A Shadow, 
unable to dodge, is knocked backward in a flurry of stars. With a few more 
swings, the darkness of the Shadows is driven away by the might of the 
blade, and they vanish. With as many as he defeats, more appear and Sora 
races back across the bridge. He sees a strange door over the entrance to 
the Secret Place. The door opens and he runs inside to find...)

Sora: Kairi!

(She stands heavily in front of the door-like wall of the cave. A soft 
hum hangs in the air as she slowly turns toward him, her empty eyes weak 
with exhaustion)

Kairi: Sora...

(Sora is startled to see her like this as she struggles to move forward 
to him, lifting a hand toward him. Suddenly, the door behind her gives way 
and a great wind billows forth. Sora stands his ground, covering his face 
as Kairi loses her grip, flying toward him. He opens his arms to catch her, 
but just as she reaches him, she vanishes and he catches nothing. 
Astonished by this, he loses his ground as the dark wind knocks him 
harshly out of the cave. He comes to on the beach with a grunt, the purple 
sky stretching around the island. Sora kneels in the sand looking around 
at the island below him. Large chunks of the island have broken off and 
risen into the sky towards the dark orb)

Sora: Whoa!

(The orb looms above him, lightning crackling in its dark depths as the 
wind swirls in the air with rocky and wooden debris. Sora senses a 
presence behind him, and stands, turning around to see the demon from his 
dreams, Darkside, gazing down at him through black tendrils. Sora takes 
out the Keyblade as Darkside kneels on the ground. Energy pulses in the 
heart-shaped hole in its torso and it releases beams that target Sora. Sora 
begins attacking its arm, while dodging the beams of energy. Darkside 
stands, its hands out of reach of Sora, and it pauses, peering at him 
through glowing yellow eyes. Sora waits, watching its every move. It leans 
forward clenching its hand into a fist, gathering strength, before 
slamming the fist into the ground, spewing darkness along the sandy floor. 
Shadows emerge from the dark pool. Sora races through them to the demon’s 
wrist, running along its black arm. He makes his way to Darkside’s shoulder 
and slams the blade into the creature’s face. The wind howls louder as the 
island creeps further toward the orb of energy. Sora drops to the ground 
as Darkside is pulled into the air. The wind whipping at him, he grabs a 
wooden board stuck in the sand and holds on for dear life. Every muscle 
in his body tenses as the wind pulls him upward. His fingers slowly lose 
their grip and he is sucked into the orb, screaming. Meanwhile in a quiet 
village, Goofy, Donald, and Pluto walk through town. Something in the 
sky catches Goofy’s attention and he stops, gazing upward. Donald turns 
around as Goofy points upward. Donald follows his gaze and gasps)

Goofy: Look, a star’s goin’ out!

(A bright star in the night sky twinkles and blinks out of existence. 
Donald’s face turns serious)

Donald: Come on. Let’s hurry.

(Goofy nods and they walk through the center of the main district toward 
a flight of steps. The neon letters of the various shops blink in the 
night air while a few townsfolk inhabit the picturesque town square. 
Pluto runs ahead of the two)

Donald: Where’s that key...

Goofy: Hey, ya know, maybe we ought to go find Leon.

(They reach the top of the steps in front of an accessory shop. Pluto 
sniffs around a dark alleyway, while Donald walks off to the right on 
his own course. Goofy notices Pluto and stops)

Goofy: Uh, Donald. Ya know, I betcha that...

Donald: Aw, what do you know, you big palooka?

(Donald continues walking)

Goofy: What do I know? Hmm...

(He ponders this for a second before following Donald)

Goofy (calling): Come on, Pluto.

(Pluto continues his search down the alley, turning a corner at a pile 
of wooden crates. He comes across a sleeping Sora and licks his face. 
Sora’s eyes blink open slowly and he peers around sleepily, seeing the 
dog, who happily wags his tail at the sight of him)

Sora: What a dream...

(He starts nodding off again and Pluto pounces on him. He gives off a 
startled yell)

Sora: This isn’t a dream!

(He squints at the dog, his eyes focusing for a moment, before standing 
up. He searches his surroundings. Several notices are pinned up on a wall 
nearby, but even in the dimness of the alleyway, what he sees is not 
familiar)

Sora: Where am I?

(He turns toward the brighter end of the alley)

Sora: Oh, boy.

(He bends down to address Pluto)

Sora: Do you know where we are?

(Pluto hears a voice calling him and runs back the way he came)

Sora: Hey...

(Sora follows the dog to the main part of town, where he can finally see 
in the brightness of the streetlights)

Sora: This is totally weird... I’m in another world!

(Sora walks into the Accessory Shop. A blond man standing behind the 
counter turns to face him)

???: Hey there, how can I... Aw, it’s only a kid.

Sora: I’m not a kid! And the name’s Sora!

???: Okay, okay, simmer down. So why the long face, Sora? You lost or 
somethin’?

Sora: No! Well, maybe. Where are we?

???: Huh?

(Sora explains what happened to his world)

Sora: Traverse Town... So, gramps, is this really another world?

???: Don’t call me gramps! The name’s Cid!

(He grits his teeth, nearly breaking the piece of straw in his mouth)

Cid: Anyway... Not sure what you’re talkin’ about, but this sure ain’t your 
island.

Sora: Hmm... Guess I’d better start looking for Riku and Kairi.

Cid: Well, good luck with whatever it is you’re doing. If you ever run 
into trouble, you come to me.

(Sora leaves the shop and finds the entrance to the Second District. As 
he enters, a man stumbles out in front of him. A glowing heart bursts 
from his chest and floats over to an orb of darkness. They merge and form 
a creature similar to a Soldier, with a strange emblem on its chest. It 
moves awkwardly, doing a somersault in the air before disappearing. Sora 
rushes over to where the man’s body once lay and a group of Shadows 
surrounds him)

Sora: It’s those creatures from the island!

(Sora defeats the creatures and runs inside a nearby Hotel as Donald and 
Goofy enter the area)

Goofy (looking around): Doesn’t look like he’s here.

Donald: Keep looking!

(After finding no one at the Hotel, Sora returns to town and enters the 
Gizmo Shop as Donald and Goofy walk out of the Hotel)

Donald: Hmph. Where is he?

Goofy (calling): Leeeooon!

(Sora passes through the Gizmo Shop and finds a large ornate door. He 
enters as Donald and Goofy leave the Gizmo Shop)

Donald: Not here, either.

Goofy: This could take a while...

(Inside the house, Sora finds two adult Dalmatians, who look sad. Despite 
the many rooms of the house, they are all empty. Unable to help them, Sora 
leaves, passing through an alleyway back to the Second District. Finding 
nothing, he decides to return to the First District. As he enters the 
double doors, Donald and Goofy exit the Hotel again)

Donald (calling): Leeeon! Mister Leon?

Goofy (calling): Where are you?

(Sora battles his way back to the Accessory Shop)

Cid: Still haven’t found ‘em? Keep your chin up. Take another look around 
town.

(Sora walks back into town)

??????: They’ll come at you out of nowhere.

Sora (whirling around): Who are you?

??????: And they’ll keep on coming at you, as long as you continue to 
wield the Keyblade.

(A tall man enters in a leather outfit, the lion necklace swinging against 
his chest. He raises a gloved hand and points at the Keyblade, his blue 
eyes gazing at Sora through his long dark hair. There is a large scar 
above his nose)

??????: But why? Why would it choose a kid like you?

(He places a hand to his forehead)

Sora: What’s that supposed to mean?

??????: Never mind. Now, let’s see that Keyblade.

(He walks slowly towards Sora, his arm reaching out. Sora takes a 
defensive stance)

Sora: What? There’s no way you’re getting this!

??????: All right, then have it your way.

(The man takes out a Gunblade, slinging it over his shoulder before 
holding it firmly in his strong hands. He summons a Fire spell and 
shoots it at Sora, who dodges and runs toward the man. He gets in a 
few hits with the Keyblade before taking a large hit from the Gunblade, 
knocking him backward. He runs further away, but the man leaps over 
and corners him. He leaps over the wall to the main square and the man 
shoots another Fire spell at him, which Sora blocks and sends flying 
back at the man. Sora stops for a second, hearing nothing and runs back 
over the wall to find the man stunned. As he gets closer, the man snaps 
back and strikes him hard in the chest. Sora stands for a second, 
wobbling on his feet, before falling over backward onto the cobblestone 
ground. The man stands back up, hearing a voice behind him)

??????: Hey, you found it. Nice going, Leon.

(He turns back to see a smiling young girl with dark hair)

Leon: Still... It looks like things are worse than we thought. A lot worse.

(He looks toward the Keyblade in Sora’s hands. Meanwhile in another world, 
Riku awakes on a cold stone platform. His fingers twitch and he opens 
his eyes, seeing a large waterfall and crystalline rock platforms floating 
in the air. The sounds of the Rising Falls fill his ears, and he slowly 
gets to his feet)

Riku: Where...am I?

(He looks around at the area. The waterfalls flow upwards rather than 
downwards, filling his vision on nearly every side. He sees no one else 
around)

Riku (calling): Sora! Kairi!

(Getting no response, he stares at the tiled ground. Unbeknownst to him, 
his arrival is noticed by a tall figure in a black cloak, who walks 
toward him on a much higher platform. The figure’s greenish-gray hand 
and long violet fingernails are revealed. Back in Traverse Town, Donald 
and Goofy walk down the Alleyway in the Second District, having no luck 
in their search. The dim light complements the empty atmosphere)

Goofy: Gawrsh, there’s nobody here. Sure is spooky!

Donald: Aw, phooey. I’m not scared.

(He feels a tap on his shoulder and screams, leaping into the air and 
hanging onto Goofy’s back, shivering)

??????: Excuse me. Did the king send you?

(At the mention of the King, Donald stops shaking and the two of them 
turn to see a young woman with flowing brown hair tied in a bow. She 
wears a long pink dress and brown boots. She smiles at the two of them. 
Soon after, Sora is starting to wake up)

Kairi: Come on, lazy bum. Wake up.

(Sora shakes his head and opens his eyes. He looks up to see Kairi 
peering down at him on the bed)

Kairi: You okay?

Sora: I guess...

Kairi: Those creatures that attacked you are after the Keyblade. But 
it’s your heart they really want, because you wield the Keyblade.

Sora: I’m so glad that you’re okay, Kairi.

Kairi: Kairi? Who are you talking about?

(Kairi’s voice changes)

??????: I’m the great ninja Yuffie.

Sora: Huh?

(Sora’s world flashes and the dark-haired girl from earlier appears in 
Kairi’s place, bending over him)

Yuffie: I think you might’ve overdone it, Squall.

(The tall man from before walks into the green room)

Leon: That’s Leon.

(Sora sees the Keyblade leaning against the wall)

Sora: The Keyblade...

Yuffie: Yeah, we had to get it away from you to shake off those creatures. 
It turns out that’s how they were tracking you.

Leon (crossing his arms): It was the only way to conceal your heart from 
them. But it won’t work for long.

(Sora sits on the bed, staring down at the floor)

Leon: Still hard to believe that you of all people are the chosen one.

(Leon picks up the Keyblade and swings it in the air. It flashes out of 
his hand and back into Sora’s. Leon walks over to him)

Leon: Well, I suppose beggars can’t be choosers.

Sora: Why don’t you start making sense! What’s going on here?

(At this point in time, Aerith has led Donald and Goofy to the adjacent 
red room)

Aerith: Okay, you know there are many other worlds out there besides 
your castle and this town, right?

Donald: Yeah.

Goofy: But they’re supposed to be a secret.

(He covers his mouth)

Aerith: They’ve been secret because they’ve never been connected. Until now.

(Her thoughts drift to nearly a decade earlier)

Aerith: When the Heartless came, everything changed.

Sora: The Heartless?

Yuffie: The ones who attacked you, you remember?

Leon: Those without hearts.

Yuffie: The darkness in people’s hearts—that’s what attracts them.

Leon: And there is darkness within every heart.

(Yuffie looks toward Sora)

Yuffie: Hey, have you heard of someone named Ansem?

Goofy: Ansem?

(He places a hand to his chin)

Aerith: He was studying the Heartless. He recorded all of his findings in 
a very detailed report.

(Donald crosses his arms and taps his foot on the wood floor)

Goofy: Gawrsh, uh, can we see it?

Aerith (shaking her head): It’s pages are scattered everywhere.

Donald: Scattered?

(Donald stops tapping)

Aerith: To many worlds.

Goofy: Oh, then maybe the king went to find ‘em.

(He slams a fist down into his hand and Donald nods)

Aerith: Yes, those were my thoughts exactly.

Goofy: We’ve gotta find him quick!

Donald: Wait!

(He looks over, and pulls the screen down towards him)

Donald: First, we need that “key”!

Aerith: That’s right. The Keyblade.

Sora: So...this is the key?

(Sora holds up the Keyblade)

Yuffie (nodding): Exactly!

Leon: The Heartless have great fear of the Keyblade.

(He walks over to the door)

Leon: That’s why they’ll keep coming after you no matter what.

Sora: Well, I didn’t ask for this.

Yuffie: The Keyblade chooses its master. And it chose you.

Leon: So tough luck.

(He leans against the door)

Sora: How did all this happen? I remember being in my room...

(He gasps sharply, standing up and looking to them frantically)

Sora: Wait a minute! What happened to my home? My island? Riku! Kairi!

Leon: You know what? I really don’t know.

(Sora looks down sadly. Yuffie tries to change the subject)

Yuffie: Hey, cheer up! I’ve heard that the Keyblade can open all sorts of 
locks. Give it a try the next time you find a treasure chest or door lock!

Leon: Sooner or later, the Heartless will find you. You’d best prepare 
yourself.

Sora: Prepare myself?

Leon: To fight for your life. Are you ready?

Sora: I’m ready!

Leon: Yuffie, let’s go join Aerith. She should be there now with the other 
visitors.

(Yuffie points to the other end of the room)

Yuffie: Leon!

(A Soldier Heartless appears, clattering awkwardly. Leon runs forward)

Leon: Yuffie, go!

(Yuffie runs into the Red Room, squashing Donald behind it with a squawk. 
Aerith’s face turns serious)

Aerith: Yuffie?

(She runs after Yuffie as Leon takes out his Gunblade)

Leon: Sora, let’s go!

(Leon slams the Heartless through the window of the room and it flies over 
the balcony and down to the Alleyway below. Leon runs after it, Sora 
following. The Red Room door closes and Goofy stares at Donald flattened 
against the wall. Down in the Alleyway, more Heartless have appeared 
around them)

Leon: Don’t bother with the small fry. Find the leader! Let’s go!

(Leon runs down the Alley toward the door to the main district. Sora fights 
Heartless as he makes his way to the Third District. Sora runs down the 
stairs into the square as Goofy watches from a high balcony. Goofy turns 
around as Heartless appear around him and Donald. He takes out his shield)

Goofy: Gawrsh, are these the Heartless guys?

(Donald swings his wand in front of him)

Donald: Let’s go get ‘em, Goofy!

(With a loud crash, the two of them are blasted off the balcony. Sora 
turns, hearing the commotion, and tries to run as Donald and Goofy fall 
on top of him. Stars appear around their heads before they see the Keyblade)

Donald &amp; Goofy: The key!

(They smile as Sora winces. The District starts to rumble and they look 
around, still in a pile on the ground. Large blocks appear from the ground 
and cover the exits. Heartless surround them as they stand up, ready to 
fight. After defeating the horde of Soldiers, they hear a clattering sound 
from above. Sora looks up to see huge pieces of armor falling from the sky. 
They hit the ground and bounce into the air, spinning wildly. The arms of 
the Guard Armor form around the torso, which is emblazoned with a red and 
black symbol. Once the legs attach, the Heartless lands on the ground 
loudly. It stands there for a moment before the helmet slams down onto the 
torso with a bright flash. It spins its head and arms before walking toward 
the trio. Sora attacks its arms, but it hardly recoils in its pursuit of 
him. Donald and Goofy do their best to strike the tough armor. It begins 
spinning its arms wildly around its body. Donald is caught in the twister 
and is knocked out. Sora strikes at one of the arms and the Guard Armor 
stomps the ground in anger. It jumps into the air and its pieces clatter 
to the ground heavily. Sora strikes an arm off while Goofy heals Donald 
and they tag-team against its thunderous legs. With the appendages 
destroyed, the torso is left defenseless and it falls to the ground. 
Sora, Donald, and Goofy approach and it begins spinning out of control, 
knocking the three of them back. Once they find their footing again, 
Sora gives the armor a final strike and it starts to explode from the 
inside, shaking the area around it. Its head wobbles and falls to the 
ground with a mighty ring. A large glowing heart floats out of its 
torso into the air and the Guard Armor disappears. The District grows 
silent, the fountain depicting two dogs in love at the edge of the 
area giving off the only sound. Later, Leon and Yuffie join the group)

Sora: So, you were looking for me?

Donald &amp; Goofy (nodding): Uh-huh!

Leon (arms crossed): They, too, have been seeking the wielder of the 
Keyblade.

(Yuffie nods)

Goofy: Hey, why don’t you come with us? We can go to other worlds on 
our vessel.

Sora (facing downward): I wonder if I could find Riku and Kairi...

(Leon closes his eyes, understanding what Sora is feeling)

Donald: Of course.

(Sora looks up at them)

Goofy (to Donald): Are you sure?

Donald (to Goofy): Who knows? But we need him to come with us to help 
us find the king.

(Leon steps forward)

Leon: Sora, go with them. Especially if you want to find your friends.

Sora (halfheartedly): Yeah, I guess.

Donald: But you can’t come along looking like that. Understand?

(He wags a finger)

Donald: No frowning. No sad face. Okay?

Goofy (interjecting): Yeah, ya gotta look funny, like us!

(Donald pushes him away)

Donald: This boat runs on happy faces.

Sora: Happy?

(Donald and Goofy smile. Sora bends down and reveals a huge cheesy grin. 
Getting no response from them, he stops awkwardly. Donald and Goofy burst 
out laughing)

Goofy (pointing): That’s one funny face!

Sora (standing up): Okay, why not? I’ll go with you guys.

Donald (holding out a hand): Donald Duck.

Goofy (doing the same): Name’s Goofy.

Sora (doing the same): I’m Sora.

Goofy: All for one, one for all.

(They place their hands together. Meanwhile, in a room full of darkness, 
a group with equally dark intentions gaze at an image of the trio on a 
round table)

?????: That little squirt took down that Heartless! Who’d have thought it?

(The fiery man looks over to a thin man with a staff, who replies)

?????: Such is the power of the Keyblade. The child’s strength is not his 
own.

(The large woman next to him gazes down cunningly at the image, water 
dripping off her many appendages)

??????: Why don’t we turn him into a Heartless?

(She cackles loudly)

??????: That’ll settle things quick enough.

(A man standing next to her pipes up)

????: And the brat’s friends are the king’s lackeys. Swoggle me eyes, 
they’re all bilge rats by the look of them.

?????: You’re no prize yourself.

(A ghostly figure beside the man laughs loudly and the man brandishes 
a silver hook as his left hand)

????: Shut up!

??????????: Enough.

(The villains look over to a tall woman in a black cloak. She gazes </pre><pre id="faqspan-2">through narrow eyes at the image on the table, her green skin echoing 
its pale light. Her long fingers curve around the staff in her hand)

??????????: The Keyblade has chosen him. Will it be he who conquers the 
darkness? Or will the darkness swallow him? Either way, he could be quite 
useful.

(She smiles darkly. Later, in the First District of Traverse Town, Sora 
talks to Leon, Yuffie, and Aerith)

Leon: Make sure you’re prepared for the journey ahead of you. We don’t 
know how far the Heartless have spread.

Yuffie: Check out the shops here. They’ve got some pretty neat stuff!

Aerith: This is from all of us.

(She hands him 500 munny)

Aerith: Spend it as you see fit. And this is from Leon.

(Leon looks away. She hands Sora an Elixir)

Yuffie: Good luck!

Aerith: I hope you find your friends.

Leon: Look out for each other. Keep your spirits up.

(Sora talks to Donald and Goofy)

Donald: The gummi ship is outside that gate.

(He looks toward the World Exit, a large gate at the edge of the area)

Sora: The what?

Donald: That’s our ship.

Goofy: Wait ‘til you see it!

Donald: Hold on. Sora, this is for you.

(Donald gives him the Fire spell)

Donald: Now you can use magic, too. Goofy, give him that other thing.

Goofy: What?

Donald: You know!

Goofy: Oh, yeah.

(Goofy gives Sora the Dodge Roll ability)

Goofy: Abilities allow you to do all sorts of things. Guess we should 
look for ‘em along the way, huh?

Sora: Okay, is that it? Let’s get going!

Donald: Not ‘til we’re ready!

Jiminy (to himself): Well, I see big adventures coming their way! Looks 
like it’s up to me to keep track of it all in my journal!

(While gathering supplies around town, Sora talks to Leon, Yuffie and 
Aerith in the café)

Leon: There are Dalmatians named Pongo and Perdita living in the Second 
District...

Sora: What’s wrong?

Leon: They’re quite upset, these Dalmatians. They’ve lost their puppies.

Yuffie: Squall can’t stop worrying about them.

Leon: Call me Leon.

Aerith: Sora, would you look for the puppies?

Leon: Help them out.

Aerith: Please, find the puppies for him.

(Leon says nothing)

Yuffie: Squa--I mean, Leon--is really cute sometimes.

(Once they are ready, Sora, Donald, and Goofy board the Gummi Ship)

Donald: We travel to different worlds on the gummi ship.

Goofy: The Heartless ships often give us a hard time.

Donald: Always be on the lookout during flight.

Goofy: Your journey will be documented until you reach your destination.

Donald: Seek out the missions each world has to offer!

(They travel to Wonderland and enter by way of Rabbit Hole. Slowly they 
drift downward, past clocks and tables and fireplaces, Goofy lying on his 
back enjoying the ride. When they reach the bottom, Sora and Donald land 
softly on their feet, while Goofy falls over with a big thump. They hear 
the quick pattering of feet as a white rabbit in a waistcoat carrying a 
large clock dashes past them)

White Rabbit: Oh, my fur and whiskers! I’m late, I’m late, I’m late! 

(He pants heavily)

White Rabbit: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! I’m here, I should be there.

(They watch him scurry away)

White Rabbit: I’m late, I’m late, I’m late! The queen, she’ll have my 
head for sure!

(They decide to follow him down the hall, where they reach a door, which 
reveals a smaller door underneath. They enter the Bizarre Room and see 
the White Rabbit scurrying across the tiled floor, several sizes smaller 
than before. The ticking sounds of a multitude of clocks lining the walls 
fills their ears as they watch the rabbit run through a small wooden 
door with a large doorknob on the edge of the room. Sora walks over to 
the door and kneels down in front of it)

Sora: How did he get so small?

Doorknob: No, you’re simply too big.

(Donald jumps)

Donald: It talks!

(Sora looks at it in surprise and confusion. The doorknob yawns)

Doorknob: Must you be so loud? You woke me up.

Goofy (cheerfully): Good morning.

Doorknob: Good night! I need a bit more sleep.

(It yawns again. Sora gets closer)

Sora: Wait, what do we have to do to grow small?

Doorknob: Why don’t you try the bottle...over there?

(Sora turns and sees a table and chair form out of the floor. Two bottles 
appear on the table. The trio drink from the blue bottle and shrink down 
to the size of the door. Heartless appear and they defeat them, but by 
that time, the doorknob has gone back to sleep and the door will not open. 
They find another entrance to the Queen’s Castle. Several soldiers stand 
guard as a trial is in progress inside a large hedge maze. Several roses 
line the hedges, some red and some white. A procession of cards parts to 
allow the trio to enter as a small blond girl in a blue pinafore dress is 
standing at a defendant’s table. She looks up to the bench and is 
addressed by a large scary woman wearing a crown. The White Rabbit runs 
up a podium and catches his breath before sounding a note with a trumpet)

White Rabbit: Court is now in session!

Alice: I’m on trial? But why?

White Rabbit: Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts, presiding!

(The queen sits at the bench frowning in a red and black gown, holding a 
heart-shaped fan)

Queen of Hearts: This girl is the culprit. There’s no doubt about it. And 
the reason is...because, I say so, that’s why!

Alice: That is so unfair!

(The queen taps her fan like a gavel)

Queen of Hearts: Well, have you anything to say in your defense?

Alice: Of course! I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong!

(Alice folds her arms and the White Rabbit gasps)

Alice: You may be queen, but I’m afraid that doesn’t give you the right 
to be so...so mean!

(The queen scowls)

Queen of Hearts (yelling): Silence! You dare defy me?

(She slams her fists on the bench)

Sora: Hey, guys, we should help her out.

Donald: Yeah, but the--

Goofy: We’re outsiders, so wouldn’t that be muddling?

Donald: “Meddling”!

Goofy: Oh, yeah. A-hyuck! And that’s against the rules.

Queen of Hearts: The court finds the defendant...

(She raises her fan)

Queen of Hearts: Guilty as charged!

(Alice looks astonished)

Queen of Hearts: For the crimes of assault and attempted theft of my heart...

(Sora gasps)

Queen of Hearts (yelling): Off with her head!

(She points to the girl and the Card Soldiers gather around her)

Alice: No! No! Oh, please!

Sora (running in): Hold it right there!

(Donald and Goofy run after him)

Queen of Hearts (angrily): Who are you? How dare you interfere with my court?

Sora: Excuse me. But we know who the real culprit is!

Goofy: Uh-huh. It’s the Heartle—

(Goofy covers his mouth quickly and looks at Sora)

Sora: Anyway, she’s not the one you’re looking for.

(He points to Alice as the queen leans on the bench, tapping her finger)

Queen of Hearts: That’s nonsense. Have you any proof?

(She smirks at a speechless Sora and Alice is imprisoned in a cage next to 
the bench)

Queen of Hearts: Bring me evidence of Alice’s innocence! Fail, and it’s 
off with all of your heads! Gather as much or little evidence as you please. 
Report back here once you’re ready.

(Sora talks to Alice while a Card Soldier stands guard)

Alice: Who are you?

Sora: I’m Sora.

Goofy: I’m Goofy, and that there’s Donald.

Alice: Pleased to meet you, though I do wish it were under better 
circumstances. I’m sorry you got mixed up in this nonsense.

Sora: Why are you on trial in the first place?

Alice: I should like to know the very same thing! Apparently I was guilty 
from the moment I took the stand!

Sora: That’s crazy! So, where are you from?

Alice: Hmm, curious. I can’t quite remember. You see, I found this 
mysterious rabbit hole. When I tried to peek inside, I tumbled in head 
over heels... And I found myself here.

Sora: So you’re from another world!

Goofy: That’s funny. Maybe you don’t need a ship, then.

Donald: I don’t get it.

Alice: What do you mean “another world”?

Card Soldier: Enough! The defendant will be silent!

(Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter the Lotus Forest and look around. A cat’s 
face appears out of thin air, except this cat was smiling widely. It’s 
head bounces around the area, in and out of vision, until resting atop 
a large tree stump. The cat’s body appears, standing on its head rather 
comically. It’s body is lined with purple stripes. It steps off and 
places its head back on its body, grinning incessantly)

Donald (yelling): Who are you?

Cheshire Cat: Who, indeed? Poor Alice. Soon to lose her head, and she’s 
not guilty of a thing!

Sora: Hey, if you know who the culprit is, tell us!

Cheshire Cat: The Cheshire Cat has all the answers—but doesn’t always 
tell. The answer, the culprit, the cat all lie in darkness.

(The cat vanishes)

Sora: Wait!

Cheshire Cat: They’ve already left the forest. I won’t tell which exit. 
There are four pieces of evidence in all. Three are a cinch to find. The 
fourth is tricky. Big reward if you find them all.

Donald: Should we trust him?

(The cat returns)

Cheshire Cat: To trust, or not to trust? I trust you’ll decide!

(He disappears. The trio defeats Heartless in the Lotus Forest before 
finding some Footprints near a large flower. After climbing to one of 
the tree tops, Sora finds a hole in the trunk of a tree. They enter it 
and find themselves in the Bizarre Room again, this time on top of the 
huge stone stove. Near the two burners, they find a Stench. They return 
to the Lotus Forest and travel further in, finding a large boulder and 
several Dalmatian puppies. They climb the boulder and reach a lily pad, 
where they discover an Antenna. As they travel along lily pads, they see 
a hole in a high corner of the woods. They make their way over and enter. 
They fall into the Bizarre Room, on top of a faucet sticking out of the 
wall. Jumping to a nearby wooden ledge, they find some Claw Marks. After 
saving this evidence, the Cheshire Cat appears on the faucet, still grinning)

Cheshire Cat: Well, look what you’ve found. Nice going.

Sora: Now we can save Alice.

Cheshire Cat: Don’t be so sure! She may be innocent, but what about you?

Sora: What do you mean?

Cheshire Cat: I won’t tell. But I’ll give you something.

(The Cheshire Cat gives them the Blizzard spell and disappears. They return 
to the Queen’s Castle and speak to a Card Soldier)

Card Soldier: Are you ready to present evidence before the queen?

Sora: Yes.

Card Soldier: Very well. Counsel, step up to the podium.

(Sora stands at the defendant’s table, while Donald and Goofy are in a 
separate box)

Queen of Hearts: Now, show me what you have found.

(Sora presents their four items of evidence)

Queen of Hearts: Well, that’s certainly a lot of evidence, but I’m still 
not impressed. Cards! Bring forth my evidence!

(The cards present the queen’s box of evidence and the five boxes are 
shuffled around to Sora’s confusion)

Queen of Hearts: Hmm, checking all five would only be a waste of time. All 
right, then. Choose the one you wish to present. I’ll decide who’s guilty 
based on that evidence.

Sora: What? After all the trouble of collecting it?

Queen of Hearts (yelling): You dare object? Then you will lose your head! 
Now, choose! One box!

(Sora chooses one of the boxes)

Queen of Hearts: Are you certain? No second chances!

Sora: I’m sure.

Queen of Hearts: Now we shall see who the real culprit is.

(Inside the box is a Soldier Heartless)

Queen of Hearts: What in the world was that?

Sora: There’s your evidence. Alice is innocent.

Queen of Hearts: Rrrrrrrgh... Silence! I’m the law here!

(She pounds on the bench)

Queen of Hearts: Article 29: Anyone who defies the queen is guilty!

Donald (jumping up and down): That’s crazy!

Queen of Hearts (shouting): Seize them at once!

(The podiums and hedges disappear and a large crank tower rises from 
the floor. The Ten of Spades runs over to the tower’s gear and turns it, 
raising Alice’s cage at the bench. The queen lifts her fan and the cards 
leap into battle)

Queen of Hearts: Cards! If they touch the tower, you lose your heads!

(They begin attacking the red and black Card Soldiers who come at them 
with axes. After knocking a couple out, they flutter to the ground 
unconscious)

Queen of Hearts: Get them, you fools! Quit joking around!

(Sora runs up to the Queen of Hearts, who tries to fight back with magic 
from her fan. Sora dodges this and knocks her over, exposing her heart-
patterned bloomers. At this point, the Card Soldiers freeze on the spot 
for fear of their queen. Sora runs back over and starts slamming the 
Keyblade into the crank tower, with each strike lowering Alice’s cage)

Queen of Hearts (angrily): Why, you!

(Eventually, the tower starts to crack and shatters to pieces. The 
flamingo head holding up Alice’s cage drops to the ground and the 
curtain pulls back. Sora runs forward as the Queen of Hearts peers 
over the bench to see an empty cage)

Donald: She must’ve gotten kidnapped while we were fighting.

Queen of Hearts (slamming her fist): You fools!

(The cards stand at attention)

Queen of Hearts: Find the one who’s behind this! I don’t care how!

(The Card Soldiers run in various directions at the queen’s orders. Sora 
talks to the Card Soldier in charge of Alice’s detainment)

Card Soldier: I just looked away for a moment, and...

(Sora, Donald, and Goofy walk back into the Lotus Forest and see a flower 
sneeze up a rock. It lands near the pond and the Cheshire Cat appears, 
standing on his front legs)

Sora: Have you seen Alice?

Cheshire Cat: Alice, no. Shadows, yes!

Goofy: Where did they go?

Cheshire Cat: This way? That way? Does it matter? Left, right, up, down! 
All mixed up thanks to the shadows! Step deeper into the forest to the 
deserted garden. You might find shadows in the upside-down room!

(The cat vanishes and Heartless appear again. Once they dispel the horde 
of creatures, they find a thirsty flower)

Flower: Give me a potion and I’ll make you bigger.

(Sora obliged and grew until he could almost touch the treetops. He knocks 
the boulder into the pond and more lily pads rise out of it. He finds a 
large nut at the top of a tree and uses his Keyblade to knock it down. He 
eats it and returns to Donald and Goofy’s size. They travel to the back 
of the wood and find another entrance to the Bizarre Room. This time, they 
find themselves standing on the side of the room. More Heartless appear 
and in the shuffle, Sora knocks a teddy bear off a shelf and it falls 
horizontally onto the armchairs below. Sora lights one of the lamps in 
the room, which reveals a painting on the floor of a beach in both night 
and day. They enter the painting and return to the Lotus Forest. At the 
furthest part of the forest, they enter the Tea Party Garden, seeing a 
long table with several chairs. Teapots and dinnerware line the table as 
lanterns hang overhead. A painting of the Mad Hatter and the March Hare 
is hung at the edge of the table. The expressions on their faces is one 
of sadness. A sign is posted next to them reading “A very merry unbirthday. 
Sit down to get your present.” They sit at various chairs and the Hatter 
&amp; Hare’s painted expressions change to ones of joy and happiness. The enter 
the door in the house nearby and find themselves standing on the ceiling of 
the Bizarre Room. The Cheshire Cat sits waiting for them)

Cheshire Cat: They’re hiding somewhere. And the momeraths outgrabe. Want 
to find the shadows? Try turning on the light.

(The cat vanishes and Sora jumps onto one of the lamps and lights it. The 
cat reappears on the other lamp)

Cheshire Cat: It’s too dim. Make it brighter.

Sora: What next?

Cheshire Cat: One more lamp that you need to light.

(The cat disappears and Sora lights the other lamp, summoning the cat 
once more)

Cheshire Cat: All the lights are on. You’ll see the shadows soon. They’ll 
arise in this room, but somewhere else. The shadows might go after that 
doorknob, too.

(The cat leaves and they make their way back to the Queen’s Castle to 
enter the correct way into the Bizarre Room. Upon entering the room, 
they spot the Cheshire Cat on the table)

Cheshire Cat: You’ll have a better view from higher up.

(Sora, Donald, and Goofy climb the table and the cat stands up)

Cheshire Cat: The shadows should be here soon.

(He taps his toes daintily on the table)

Cheshire Cat: Are you prepared for the worst? If not, too bad!

(He points upward and the enormous Trickmaster Heartless appears. It 
lands on the floor with its accordion-like hands and jumps over the 
table, landing on its large pointed boots. It stands up to its full 
height, towering over the table, unraveling both of its long arms. It 
stares down at them with its five stacked heads. It folds its arms 
together and pulls out two giant matches, twirling them in the air. Sora 
gets a running start, leaping off the table and striking at the 
Trickmaster’s faces as it raises its matches high in the air. It slams 
them down onto the chair, sending it flattened into the floor. Sora 
jumps up, using the length of his Keyblade to deal blows to the Trickmaster. 
He knocks it out for a second, and it falls to its knees, though not for 
long. It starts to sing to itself and swings wildly, hitting Donald, who 
shrieks. It continues twirling the matches, walking over to the stove. It 
bends over the stove and lights them, sending fireballs at the three of 
them. Goofy blocks them with his shield and Sora sends a Blizzard spell, 
effectively putting the fire out. After several more hits, the Trickmaster 
lowers its arms and falls to the ground. It attempts to stand, but crashes 
to the ground, its arms laying at its side. A large heart floats of its 
torso and it disappears. Sora hears a noise behind him and turns, seeing 
the doorknob yawning)

Doorknob: What a racket. How’s a doorknob to get any sleep?

(It yawns widely and they see a Keyhole inside its mouth. A light shines 
around Sora’s Keyblade and it reacts with a will of its own, pointing at 
the Keyhole and releasing a beam of white light. They hear a locking 
sound and the doorknob finishes yawning)

Donald: What was that?

Sora: You hear that? Sounded like something closed.

(A small green object falls to the ground in front of them, shining)

Goofy: This gummi ain’t like the others. No, sir.

Donald: Okay, I’ll hold on to it.

(Donald picks up the gummi block and the Cheshire Cat appears on the 
table, peering down at them)

Cheshire Cat: Splendid. You’re quite the hero. If you’re looking for 
Alice, she’s not here. She’s gone! Off with the shadows, into darkness.

(The cat vanishes with his grin)

Sora: No...

Donald: Let’s go back to our gummi ship. We might find her in another world.

Goofy: We've gotta go to a save point to return to our ship.

(Sora, Donald, and Goofy return to the gummi ship and travel to the 
Olympus Coliseum. They enter the Coliseum Gates, where two giant golden 
statues of gladiators clashing swords stand around the entrance. They 
walk across the grounds and enter the Coliseum. Walking into the dim 
lobby, the cracks in the stone visible underfoot, a satyr is putting 
up a sign on the wall near an entrance. A “closed” sign is tied in the 
dark doorway and a large pedestal is placed against a wall near a lit 
torch. Sora walks up to the busy-looking satyr)

Sora: Um...

???? (without looking): Good timing. Give me a hand, will ya? Move that 
pedestal over there for me.

(He points to the pedestal, still facing the sign on the wall)

????: I gotta spruce this place up for the games.

(Sora, Donald and Goofy walk over to the pedestal and attempt to move 
it, but it doesn’t budge)

Sora: It weighs a ton!

(They talk to the satyr again)

Sora: It’s way too heavy!

????: What? Too heavy? Since when have you been such a little—

(He turns around, expecting to see someone much taller. He looks down 
at Sora)

Philoctetes: Oh. Wrong guy. What’re you doing here?

(He hops down to their level and gaits toward Donald, who backs away)

Philoctetes: This here’s the world-famous Coliseum—heroes only! And I 
got my hands full preparing for the games. So run along, pip-squeaks.

(Sora pouts and the satyr puts his hands on his hips)

Philoctetes: Look, it’s like this.

(He paces around)

Philoctetes: Heroes are coming from all over to fight ferocious monsters 
right here in the Coliseum.

Donald (crossing his arms): You’ve got heroes standing right in front of you.

(Goofy places his hands on Sora’s shoulders, and Sora smiles)

Goofy: Yup. He’s a real hero chosen by the Keyblade!

Donald (pointing to himself): And we’re heroes, too.

Philoctetes (shocked): Hero? That runt?

(He laughs loudly, slapping his large belly)

Sora: What’s so funny? I’ve fought a bunch of monsters!

(Sora pounds on his chest proudly)

Philoctetes: Hey, if you can’t even move this...

(He attempts to push the pedestal forward, making no progress)

Philoctetes: You can’t call yourself...

(He tries pushing with his back against it, his hooves slipping on the 
floor. Sora crosses his arms sternly)

Philoctetes: A hero!

(He wears himself out and sits on the ground, trying to catch his breath)

Philoctetes: Okay, so it takes more than brawn.

(He stands back up)

Philoctetes: Well, well, let’s see what you can do. This trial is tough. 
You got what it takes? You ready?

Sora: I’m ready!

Philoctetes: Okay, kid. Let’s see what you’ve got.

(They enter the Coliseum, where several piles of barrels are set up around 
the arena)

Philoctetes: The rules are simple: Bust all the barrels within the time 
limit. Ready? Go!

(Sora takes out all the barrels with seconds to spare)

Philoctetes: Not bad! For a beginner, that is.

(Sora blasts through a harder course)

Philoctetes: Hey, you’re better than I thought!

(They return to the Lobby)

Philoctetes: You know, you ain’t bad, kid.

(Sora scratches his head, chuckling)

Sora: Looks like I’m headed for the games.

(Sora puts his hands behind his head, smiling)

Philoctetes: Afraid not.

Sora (surprised): Why not?

Philoctetes: Two words: You guys ain’t heroes.

(Goofy counts on his fingers)

Sora: Come on!

Philoctetes: Wanna become a real hero? Start by mastering this spell.

(Phil gives them the Thunder spell and they walk outside, stopping when 
they hear a voice)

Hades: Rather a stubborn old goat, wouldn’t you say?

Donald: Who are you?

Hades: Whoa, hold on there, fuzz boy. Wait, let me guess. You want to 
enter the games, right?

(He walks over to them, the blue flame dancing on his head. He stands 
behind Sora, placing his long-fingered hand on his shoulder)

Hades: Well, then, hey, get a load of this.

(A piece of papyrus appears in Hades’s hand, much to Sora’s surprise)

Sora: A pass?

Hades: It’s all yours.

(He starts to leave after giving him the Entry Pass)

Hades: Good luck, kid. I’m pulling for you, little shorty.

(They run back inside and talk to Phil, giving him the Entry Pass)

Philoctetes: Hey, how’d you get this?

Sora: Can we enter the games now?

Philoctetes: Well... I guess so. We start with the preliminaries! Some 
real weirdos signed up for the games. Better watch yourself.

(Sora, Donald, and Goofy fight through the starting matches of the 
preliminaries. Afterward, they talk to Phil in the Coliseum)

Philoctetes: You’re no heroes yet, but you ain’t doing bad. Lucky you 
came to me for coaching.

(Phil strokes his goatee as a soldier enters the arena. Sora stares at 
him and he stares back through spiky blond hair, his long red cape flying 
behind him, boots digging into the ground)

Philoctetes: Something tells me he’ll be a tough one to beat. Who knows, 
maybe you’ll end up facing him.

(The trio fights through more matches and speaks with Phil)

Philoctetes: Say, you’re better than I thought, kid! Wish he was here to 
see this.

Sora: Who?

Philoctetes: Hercules. He’s a hero if ever there was one. Too bad he’s off 
visiting his father.

(They fight through more of the preliminaries and celebrate while Hades 
watches from the barracks)

Hades: That little punk is your next opponent, okay?

(The blond soldier leans against the wall next to him)

Hades: Now, don’t blow it. Just take him out.

Cloud: The great god of the Underworld is afraid of a kid? Sorry, but my 
contract says—

Hades (snappy): I know! You think I don’t know? I wrote the contract! I 
know it says you’re only required to kill Hercules in this tournament. But 
you’ve gotta fight that kid to get to him. Come on.

(He points to Sora, who is talking to Phil and scratching his head)

Hades: Hey, it’s like that old goat says: Rule 11: It’s all just a game, 
so let loose and have fun with it!

(He punches the air)

Hades: I mean, a casualty along the way is no big deal, right?

(He smiles and Cloud stands up and walks away)

Hades: Geez. Stiffer than the stiffs back home. Still, suckers like him 
are hard to come by...

(In the darkness behind him, a large creature snarls. Sora, Donald, and 
Goofy finish the preliminaries and enter the final match against Cloud. 
Sora attacks with his Keyblade, while Goofy moves in with his shield. Cloud 
swings his giant sword and knocks them both back)

Cloud: That’s the best you can do?

(Sora slides forward and strikes, but he dodges backward and jumps into 
the air. Cloud slams his sword into the ground with unnatural strength, 
knocking out Donald. Giving a loud yell, Cloud surges forward and strikes, 
knocking Goofy out before he can heal Donald. Sora does his best against 
Cloud, but being a recruit of SOLDIER, his experience is unmatched, and he 
knocks the wind out of Sora. He walks over to a kneeling Sora, Donald and 
Goofy unconscious around them, and he peers down at the boy. Phil runs in 
with a white towel, but Hades stops him. Cloud raises his sword and Sora 
closes his eyes, bracing himself. Cloud lowers his sword to Sora’s surprise, 
and he hears footsteps behind him, turning just as a giant black claw 
crashes down on him. Sora looks up to see an enormous three-headed beast 
with red eyes growling over him. Darkness emanates from its jaws, each of 
its razor sharp teeth bared. Sora gasps as Hades retreats into the barracks)

Hades: Oh, right, there was one other rule I forgot: Accidents happen.

(The beast moves in to attack Sora, but is pushed back by an incredibly 
strong man)

Philoctetes: Herc!

(Hercules holds back the monster, shouting to Phil)

Hercules: Phil, get them out of here!

(The four of them race out of the Coliseum)

Philoctetes: Whew, that was close! That was Cerberus, the guardian of 
the Underworld. Herc should be able to handle him. But then again, maybe 
not... This doesn’t look good. I hope Herc’s okay. Wish I could go in!

(Sora starts to run back into the Coliseum)

Philoctetes: Kid, you’re not entering the arena, are ya? This ain’t just 
some match. This is for real!

Sora: I’m not afraid. You can decide if I’m hero material or not.

Philoctetes: Careful, kid!

(Sora and company reenters the Coliseum arena, where Hercules has Cloud 
slung over his shoulder, Cerberus’s giant jaws bearing down on him, inches 
away. The beast’s ears perk up, hearing their entrance and they turn 
around, allowing Hercules to run Cloud to the Lobby, past Phil)

Philoctetes: Kid, I got two words of advice for you: Attack!

(Cerberus roars and stomps around the arena, sending large fireballs at 
Sora, Donald, and Goofy. Sora manages to stay out of the beast’s path, 
Donald sending Thunder spells at its three heads. One of the fireballs 
heads Sora’s way, and he deflects it with his Keyblade, hitting the center 
head square in the eyes. The beast stops, roaring, and attempts to bite 
him as he attacks. Backing up, Cerberus rears up on its hind legs, and 
drops to the ground, sending a shockwave to the trio. Sora heals with a 
Potion as the beast’s mouth foams with dark energy. It moves forward 
sending dark matter spewing out of its mouth and into the ground. Sora 
rolls to dodge as the energy pools and shoots up from under him. Goofy, 
finding a way on top of the beast, sends his shield flying at the 
multiple heads. Sora moves in as it tries to bite at Goofy and knocks 
out the beast, which falls to the ground loudly. Later, Hercules and 
Phil are addressing Sora, Donald, and Goofy in the Lobby. Phil reads 
from a piece of papyrus as Hercules stands with his arms crossed)

Philoctetes: Thus, I do hereby dub thee junior heroes, and confer upon 
thee full rights and privileges to participate in the games. Further—

Donald: Hey! What do you mean “junior heroes”?

Philoctetes: You rookies still don’t understand what it takes to be a 
true hero.

Goofy: So, what does it take?

Hercules: Well, that’s just something you’ll have to find out for 
yourselves. Just the way that I did.

(He smiles)

Sora: No problem. We’ll start by proving ourselves in the games.

(Sora smiles, lifting a fist proudly)

Philoctetes: There ain’t gonna be any games for a while.

(He motions to the “closed” sign over the arena entrance)

Philoctetes: Gotta clean up the mess from that last battle first.

Sora: Okay, we’ll be back.

(He waves, and the three of them leave as Hercules waves goodbye and 
Phil strokes his beard)

Philoctetes: I still can’t believe that squirt actually beat Cerberus.

Hercules (to Phil): Just between us, I’d already worn Cerberus down by 
the time the little guy jumped in.

(The door closes)

Philoctetes: My lips are sealed.

(At the Coliseum Gates, Sora sees Cloud sitting near the exit and walks 
up to him)

Sora: Hey, are you all right?

(Cloud looks up to see him)

Cloud: Yeah.

Sora: So why did you go along with him, anyway?

(He leans his head pensively on his hands)

Cloud: I’m looking for someone. Hades promised to help. I tried to 
exploit the power of darkness, but it backfired.

(He stands up and looks to the sky)

Cloud: I fell into darkness, and I couldn’t find the light.

Sora: You’ll find it. I’m searching, too.

(He looks back at Sora)

Cloud: For your light?

(Sora nods and Cloud moves closer to him, placing something in his hand)

Cloud: Don’t lose sight of it.

(He starts to walk away, and Sora nods and looks in his hand)

Sora: How about a rematch sometime? Fair and square, no dark powers 
involved.

(He moves toward Cloud, waving his hand in the air. Cloud turns his 
head, running a hand through his hair)

Cloud: I think I’ll pass.

(Despite this answer, Sora smiles as Cloud leaves. With Sonic Blade 
in hand, Sora exits the Coliseum, the doors slamming behind them. Later 
that night, Hades stands in the Coliseum Gates, fuming. He holds a 
Hercules statue in his hand)

Hades: He’s strong, he’s kind.

(The statue flexes his muscles)

Hades: He’s always there for you, and he’s handsome to boot.

(The statue crosses his arms and winks)

Hades: He’s perfect. Perfect. Perfectly infuriating! He makes me crazy.

(Hades turns red, roasting the statue. The hair on his head blazing hot, 
he explodes in a burst of flames. As the smoke settles around him, he 
catches his breath and returns to his cool blue shade)

Hades: Wait a minute. What are you worried about? All the pieces are in 
place. Relax. Here’s what you do. Let Hercules train the kid. In the next 
games, I’ll take care of them both.

(He makes a fist as the horned witch appears behind him, her staff held 
firmly in her hands)

Hades: Who invited you to the party? Stay out of this. This is my show.

??????????: As you wish. Fight to your heart’s content.

(Hades smirks, nodding, before noting the witch’s tone, and scowling as 
she disappears. Sora pilots the Gummi Ship to the next world. They hover 
over the world and see that it’s a Deep Jungle)

Goofy: Hey, Donald, maybe King Mickey’s down there.

Donald: In a backwater place like that? No way! Let’s move on.

Sora: Hold on. Riku and Kairi might be down there. Let’s just check it out.

Donald: Forget it! We’re on an important mission!

Sora: Just land!

Donald: No!

Sora: Come on!

(Sora and Donald fight over the controls of the ship)

Donald: Aw, phooey!

Sora: We’re landing!

(The ship starts to shake and decend)

Donald: Don’t touch that! Nooo!

(The ship hurtles toward the world and Sora falls out of it into a large 
treehouse, crashing through the roof. He sits on the floor, rubbing his head)

Sora: Oww...my head...

(He looks around)

Sora: Donald? Goofy?

(Out of the rafters a claw appears. Sora looks up in time to see a leopard 
pouncing in his direction. Sora leaps up and blocks with his Keyblade. He 
jumps back as the leopard lands on the wooden floor and knocks Sora away. 
The leopard roars and tries to claw at him, but he slides away and strikes 
with his Keyblade, sending it flying across the room. After a tough 
struggle, it lies on the floor, tricking Sora into coming closer. Suddenly, 
it leaps up and roars as someone enters through a hole in the ceiling. He 
spins around the rafters and leaps to the floor. As the leopard pounces 
at Sora, the man blocks its bite with a spear. The leopard struggles 
wildly, its jaws clamped around the spear. The man knocks it back, glaring 
at it, and it snarls before leaping out a window, sending shards of glass 
flying everywhere. The wild man puts away his spear and addresses Sora. 
He has long brown dreadlocks and wears a loincloth over his toned body. 
He stands low, his knuckles touching the ground like an animal)

??????: Sabor, danger.

Sora: Um...thank you.

?????? (slowly): Thank you.

Sora: Huh? Uh, what is this place?

(The man moves closer to Sora, awkwardly invading his personal space)

??????: This place, this place.

Sora: Okaaay... Where did the others go?

(He gets no response from the wild man)

Sora: Look, I got separated from my friends. Have you seen them?

(The man looks confused)

Sora (miming): Friends...

?????? (mimicking): Friends!

Sora: Right, my friends! There’s two of ‘em. The loud one is Dona—

(He stops, remembering the fight on the ship)

Sora: You know what? Never mind. I’m looking for my friends, Riku and Kairi.

?????? (slowly): Look for Riku, friends?

Sora (nodding): Right!

(In a beam of light shining in from the rafters behind the man, Sora sees 
an image of Kairi)

??????: Kairi, friends?

Sora: Uhh...right...

(He looks at the man, then back at Kairi, who walks away)

??????: Friends here.

Sora: Really!?

(The man speaks something in Mangani)

Sora: Huh?

(The man repeats)

??????: Friends here.

Sora: Not sure I understand, but show me! Take me to Riku and Kairi!

?????? (pointing to himself): Tarzan. Tarzan go.

Sora (pointing to himself): And I’m...Sora. Tarzan go, Sora go go!

(Tarzan opens the door and they leave the Tree House. Meanwhile, Donald 
and Goofy wake up on a mound in a Bamboo Thicket)

Goofy: Gawrsh, where are we?

(He looks to the sky)

Goofy: I sure hope Sora’s okay.

Donald (sitting up): Aw, who needs him? We can find the king without him.

(He feels something soft on the edge of the mound while reaching for his 
magic wand)

Donald: Huh?

(He looks down and comes face to face with a young gorilla. They both 
scream and he and Goofy hear a rustling in the jungle. As the gorilla 
runs away, it leaves a gummi block behind. Donald looks over and sees 
it shining on the ground. The rustling continues and the two swallow 
hard in fear as a tall man carrying a rifle enters the thicket. Tarzan 
jumps from the balcony of the treehouse, crawling over the netting below, 
and leads Sora down the tree by sliding on its branches. They land at 
camp, where several tables with equipment are laid out near a group of 
tents. They enter an orange tent and see a woman fumbling with a projector)

Tarzan: Jane!

(She spins around to see him)

Jane: Tarzan!

(She sees Sora)

Jane: Oh, and who is this?

Sora: Uh, hi there. I’m—

(She bends down to talk to him)

Jane: Oh, you speak English! So, then, obviously, you’re not related to 
Tarzan...

(Tarzan and Sora exchange glances)

Jane: Are you here to study the gorillas?

???????: Highly doubtful.

(They look over to see the tall man with the rifle enter the tent, with 
Donald and Goofy in tow)

Goofy: Sora!

(Sora rushes over and locks hands with Donald)

Sora: Goofy! Donald!

(Sora and Donald realize what they’re doing and part, crossing their 
arms to Goofy’s surprise. They scowl with their backs turned)

???????: A circus of clowns. Not much use for hunting gorillas.

(The tall man walks back outside)

Jane (frowning): Mr. Clayton, we’re studying them, not hunting them. This 
is research.

(She sighs)

Jane: Well, the more the merrier. Do make yourselves at home.

Sora: Well, anyway...

Donald &amp; Sora (grouchily): I’m staying.

Sora (surprised): Huh?

Goofy: Sora, look what we found. Look at this.

(He holds out the red gummi block)

Sora: What’s that?

Goofy: A gummi block. It’s the same stuff used to build our ship.

Sora: So that means...

Donald: The king could be here. So, we’ve gotta work together to look 
for him. For now.

Sora: Fine. I’ll let you tag along. For now.

(Sora talks to Jane)

Jane: Apparently Tarzan was raised in the jungle by the gorillas. 
Communicating with him still isn’t easy, but he’s learning.

Sora: So he was speaking in “gorilla” back there...

Jane: Ah, that’s right. You’re looking for your friends?

Sora: He said Riku and Kairi are here. And one word I couldn’t understand...

Jane (showing them the projector): Why don’t we try this? We’ll show 
Tarzan some slides and see if any of them match that word. Oh, what 
happened to the slides?

(Sora and company search for the slides around the campsite. They talk 
to Clayton during their search)

Clayton: Clayton’s the name. I’m a hunter, not a researcher. What? No, 
I am not trying to hunt the gorillas. But they’re so rare! I’d just 
like to get a look at them.

(They return to the tent and give Jane the slides. The first shows a 
radiant castle, which stirs something within Sora)

Goofy: What’s wrong, Sora?

Sora: What? Um...nothing. (thinking) This place... It just looks so 
familiar. But how? I’ve never been off my island.

(They show the rest of the slides to Tarzan)

Jane: Well, Tarzan?

Sora: Where are my friends, Riku and Kairi?

(Tarzan shakes his head)

Sora: Hey, I thought—

Clayton (entering): That leaves just one place.

(Sora looks up at him)

Clayton: Young man, we’ve been in this jungle for some time now. But we 
have yet to encounter these friends of yours. I’d wager they’re with the 
gorillas. But Tarzan refuses to take us to them.

Jane: Really, Mr. Clayton. Tarzan wouldn’t hide—

Clayton: Then take us there! Take us to the gorillas.

(He walks up to Tarzan)

Clayton (miming): Go-ril-las.

(Tarzan looks over at Sora and nods)

Jane: Tarzan...are you sure?

Tarzan: Tarzan go see Kerchak.

Jane: Kerchak?

Clayton: He must be the leader. Perfect. I’ll go along as an escort. 
After all, the jungle is a dangerous place.

(He smiles and they leave the tent. Sabor attacks, but is sent scurrying 
back into the jungle. They enter the Hippos’ Lagoon and find more 
Dalmatian puppies. They find some climbable ivy and take it into a 
higher area of the trees. Tarzan finds Kerchak and Kala among the trees, 
numerous vines hanging around them. Kerchak looks sternly at Sora, 
Donald, and Goofy as Tarzan pleads his case to them in Mangani)

Tarzan: Kerchak, please listen to me. I know the nesting ground is 
secret, but I trust them. You see, I want to help them because...because... 
well, they need us.

(His blue eyes show deep concern for the strangers like him. Kala looks 
over to Kerchak, who continues to glower. Goofy leans over to Sora and 
Donald)

Goofy: Uh... Did you get that?

Donald: No.

Tarzan: Kerchak.

(Kerchak turns his head silently towards the treetops, sensing something. 
He starts to leave)

Tarzan (defeated): Kerchak...

(Kala looks back at Tarzan sadly and follows Kerchak. Tarzan hangs his head)

Goofy (thinking): He seemed sorta distracted by something.

Donald (thinking): Was he looking toward the tree house?

(Inside the tree house, the young gorilla is playing with a globe. 
Clayton’s rifle glints in the sunlight as the unknowing gorilla continues 
playing. Donald runs to the tree house and screams just as Clayton 
fires. His aim off, the bullet narrowly misses Terkina, who runs away 
behind Kerchak. Sora enters with Goofy and Tarzan)

Donald: What’s the big idea?

Tarzan: Wait, Kerchak. Please!

(Kerchak walks away, scowling. Terk follows him as Donald glares at 
Clayton. Tarzan turns toward Clayton, frowning)

Clayton (miming nervously): You don’t understand. I was only trying 
to... Ah. A snake slithered by, you see. I saved that poor gorilla’s life.

(Tarzan lowers his head. The group returns to the tent and tells Jane 
everything)

Jane (angrily): How could you do such a thing!

Clayton: Now, Miss Porter, as I told you, I was not aiming at the gorilla.

Jane (angrily): You are not to go near the gorillas again!

Clayton: All because of one mishap? Come, now...

(Everyone glares at him and he drops his smirk. He laughs nervously and 
backs out of the tent. Turning away to leave, he grins cruelly. As he 
exits the tent, he takes out his rifle)

Clayton: What am I doing with these imbeciles?

(He stares out into the jungle)

Clayton: Blasted gorillas! I’ll hunt down every last one of them! I’ll 
track them down somehow.

(He takes out a pipe from his back pocket)

Clayton: I’ll stake my life on it.

(He hears a rustling from the jungle and stops before the pipe reaches 
his mouth. He puts it away and listens for the source of the noise. He 
aims his rifle into the jungle as the noise gets closer, and the shot 
rings out loud and clear. Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Tarzan run outside 
and see a gorilla surrounded by monkey-like creatures)

Sora: Heartless!

(They notice Sora and attack the group as the gorilla hides. They defeat 
the Heartless and the gorilla thanks them with a gummi block. Sora speaks 
to Jane)

Jane: Don’t mind Mr. Clayton. He’s not a bad person—just a bit impetuous.

(They search around the jungle, protecting the rest of the gorillas from 
the Heartless. They return to the tent)

Jane: I do hope Mr. Clayton is safe...

(They exit the tent and hear a gunshot from the direction of the Bamboo 
Thicket. They run into the thicket and find Clayton’s pipe on the mound 
in the center. A shadow leaps over them and Sabor lands, roaring at them, 
teeth bared. It claws the air towards Sora, but Donald sends a Fire spell 
at it. Sora strikes it with the Keyblade and it jumps into the tall stalks 
of bamboo. They wait for it to emerge, Tarzan listening keenly. It leaps 
out and Tarzan assaults it with his spear, spinning it wildly. Goofy 
tackles it with his shield and it tries to bite him. They continue 
attacking it until it slows down, its vision going blurry. Sabor looks 
up to the sun, falling unconscious, and collapses to the ground, losing 
a fang in the process. Meanwhile, Terk runs through the campsite past 
numerous Heartless and into the tent, frightening Jane and knocking her 
to the ground. Jane looks to see that the gorilla is alright before 
someone enters the tent. Jane looks up, terrified, and holds Terkina 
tightly. Sora and company return to camp to find the tent empty)

Sora: Hey, where’s Jane?

Goofy: What’s wrong, Tarzan?

Tarzan: Something coming. Jane, danger. Jane near... Near tree house.

Donald: Sounds like trouble. Let’s go.

(They race to an area in the tree tops loaded with plant life. Jane and 
Terk are imprisoned in a web of vines)

Jane: Tarzan!

(A large black fruit is attached to the tree trunk in the middle of the 
area. They take out both the Heartless and the suspicious fruit, 
releasing Jane and Terk from their cage. Light flows into the canopy 
as they talk to Jane)

Jane: Clayton came to the tent, and... That’s the last thing I remember.

Sora (surprised): Clayton?

Tarzan: Gorillas trapped. Terk ran.

Jane: We must help the gorillas!

(They run to the cliff area, where the gorillas have been rounded up 
by Clayton and the Heartless. Clayton loads and cocks his rifle, 
aiming it at Kala. Kerchak roars as Heartless pounce in his direction. 
Clayton puts his finger on the trigger as Sora runs in)

Sora: No!

(Clayton looks over to Sora and Kala and Kerchak walk away)

Sora: Clayton?

Tarzan: Not Clayton!

(He says something in Mangani again)

Tarzan: Not Clayton!

(Clayton gives out a yell and the fight begins. Donald, Goofy, and 
Tarzan go after the Heartless, while Sora takes on Clayton. The hunter 
fights back, aiming his rifle at them before the cliff behind them 
explodes. Tarzan rushes forward, but is knocked back by an invisible 
creature. It calls out and Clayton mounts it, reloading his rifle and 
aiming it at them again. Sora attacks the creature, causing it to shed 
its invisibility. The great green chameleon stares at them through wild 
spinning eyes. It sends out beams of energy before jumping up to a high 
ledge, and Donald calls down a Thunder spell, while Tarzan climbs the 
vines along the wall towards it. He stabs it with his spear and it reels 
backward, knocking Clayton from its back)

Clayton: Lazy beast!

(The Stealth Sneak Heartless fell to the ground as Clayton picks himself 
up. He aims at Sora, but is tackled by Goofy’s shield. Sora strikes the 
Heartless with a flurry of attacks while Donald casts magic spells. Tarzan 
faces Clayton and forces him towards the waterfall. He clutches his chest 
and aims his rifle at them, his eyes staring daggers. The Heartless rises 
up behind him slowly, sparks crackling around it, cause Clayton to turn 
around. It begins to fall on him and he screams. A glowing heart bursts 
from its chest and floats into the air as Clayton and the Heartless 
disappear. Kala and the other gorillas gather nearby as Kerchak walks up 
to Sora. He grabs him by the collar of his jacket and tosses him into 
the air. Sora lands with a thud on the top of the cliff. Donald and Goofy 
follow suit while Tarzan climbs to meet them. They look down towards the 
gorillas, who leave. Tarzan crawls over to the lake, where the waterfall 
roars)

Tarzan: Tarzan, home.

(They enter the deepest parts of the Waterfall Cavern and find a glowing 
nest of butterflies in the trunk of an ancient tree. Jane and Terk join 
them and Tarzan repeats the Mangani word)

Sora: This is your home? But that means...

(Tarzan stops him and places a hand to his ear)

Goofy: Huh?

(They hear the roaring sound of water)

Jane: The waterfalls... They’re echoing all the way here.

(Tarzan repeats the word)

Tarzan: Friends there. See friends.

Jane: Oh, now I’ve got it. (recites Mangani word) means heart. Friends 
in our hearts...

Tarzan: Heart...

Sora (disappointed): Oh, so that’s what it meant.

Tarzan: Friends, same heart. Clayton, lose heart. No heart, no see friends. 
No heart, no friends.

Sora (to Donald): Sorry about what I said.

Donald: I’m sorry too.

Goofy: Yeah. All for one, huh?

(He gathers them into a group hug, smiling. Sora walks up to the butterfly 
nest and they scatter around the cavern, revealing a Keyhole. Sora aims 
his Keyblade and seals the Keyhole. It glows with a bright light and a 
locking sound before a green gummi block falls to the ground, shining)

Donald: A gummi!

Goofy: But it’s sure not thing king’s.

(Terk nuzzles against Donald, who looks surprised)

Jane: I think someone has a new admirer.

(Donald starts waving his arms frantically)

Donald: No, no, no, no! Daisy would kill me!

(Sora and Goofy laugh. Meanwhile, the horned witch stands in a dark chapel 
with three other villains)

?????: What drew the Heartless to that world?

??????????: The hunter lured them there. It was his lust for power that 
was the bait. But it seems the bait was too tasty for his own good.

(A ghostly figure laughs)

?????: Yeah, he got chomped instead!

(A tall, thin man in pointed robes walks out of the shadows, a snake staff 
in his hand)

?????: A weak-hearted fool like him stood no chance against the Heartless. 
But the boy is a problem. He found one of the Keyholes.

??????????: Fear not. It will take him ages to find the rest.

(An image of Sora, Donald, and Goofy appears on the table before them)

??????????: Besides, he remains blissfully unaware of our other plan.

??????: Yes, the princesses...

??????????: They are falling into our hands, one by one. Speaking of 
which...

(Out of the shadows steps a frightened Alice. Back in Deep Jungle, 
everyone has returned to the tent)

Sora: Well, guess we’d better get going.

Jane: Where is your ship, anyway?

Donald: Well, uh... Not too far.

Tarzan: Sora, Tarzan, friends

(He hands him a keychain and they return to the gummi ship)

Sora: The gummi block that came out of that glowing hole... It’s not 
like the others. Wonder what it’s used for.

Donald: I dunno.

Goofy: Maybe Leon’ll know.

Donald: Hmm... He might. Back to Traverse Town, then?

Sora: I wanna be pilot!

Donald: Hey, stop it!

Sora: Oh, come on! I’m the Keyblade master.

Donald: I don’t care who you are! No!

Goofy: Here we go again...

(They travel back to Traverse Town and find Yuffie in the First District)

Yuffie: Leon’s probably at the underground cavern. He trains there often. 
You know, the channel in the alleyway is connected to the cavern.

(They enter the Alleyway though the Second District and find a grate at 
the edge of it. They tackle the bars and enter the Secret Waterway. They 
swim through the channel to where Leon is practicing his battle swing. 
Aerith is there with him)

Leon: So, you found the Keyhole.

Sora: Yeah. The Keyblade locked it automatically.

Aerith: Good.

Leon: Every world among the stars has a Keyhole. And each one leads to </pre><pre id="faqspan-3">the heart of that world. There must be one in this town as well.

Sora: What do you mean?

Aerith: It was in Ansem’s report.

Leon (crossing his arms): The Heartless enter through the Keyhole and do 
something to the world’s core.

Sora: What happens to the world?

Aerith: In the end, it disappears.

Sora, Donald &amp; Goofy: What!

Leon: That’s why your key is so important.

Aerith: Please lock the Keyholes. You’re the only one who can.

Sora: I don’t know...

Leon: Seeing other worlds would probably serve you well.

Donald: Yeah!

Goofy: We gotta find your friends! And King Mickey!

Sora: I guess you’re right... Okay!

(He remembers the gummi block)

Sora: Hey, Leon. This gummi block’s different from the others. Do you 
know what it’s for?

(Leon has no answer)

Aerith: Ask Cid. He should know.

Leon: Wait, Sora. Take this with you.

(He gives him a stone)

Leon: This stone holds some mysterious power. I’ve been carrying it for 
luck. I want you to hold onto it.

Sora: How do you use it?

(Leon crosses his arms, silently thinking)

Sora: Uh, Leon?

(They leave the Secret Waterway and return to the First District. They 
enter the Accessory Shop and speak to a Moogle)

Moogle: A big tournament is being held somewhere, kupo.

(They speak to Cid)

Cid: What’ve you got there? Hey! Well, if it ain’t a gummi block.

Donald: Yup.

Goofy: What’s this one for?

Cid: You’re kiddin’ me! You’re flyin’ a gummi ship and you don’t know 
nothin’ about navigation gummis? Bunch of pinheads. Interspace ain’t no 
playground.

Sora: There’s a lot we don’t know. So what! We have to use the gummi 
ship to go to other worlds. We don’t have a choice.

Cid: Whoa, easy.

(He scratches his head)

Cid: I didn’t know. No hard feelings, all right? Well, I guess I could 
lend y’all a hand, then.

Sora: Thanks.

Cid: Basically, with navigation gummis, you can go to new places. You 
want one on your ship, right?

(They nod)

Cid: I’ll install it for you. But I got this thing I gotta go deliver first.

Sora: What do you need to deliver?

Cid: Just this book. It’s real old. When the guy brought it in, it was 
practically falling apart. Too beat up to restore it to the way it was. 
But overall, I did a decent job puttin’ it back together. Anyway, you 
mind deliverin’ it for me? It’s the old house past the Third District. 
Look for a big fire sign.

(He hands Sora the old book before a loud bell rings)

Sora: Wh-What was that?

Cid: Hmm? The bell at the gizmo shop is ringing. Go check it out if you 
want, but deliver that book for me first. When you’re done, stop by the 
house in the Third District. I’ll be there.

(They leave the shop and enter the Third District, finding the fire sign 
at the end of an alley. Sora hits it with a Fire spell and the door 
unlocks. They enter a large cavern where a mystical house sits on a 
central island. Several stepping stones line the path in the water. Sora 
jumps on them and they begin to move rhythmically. Timing themselves, 
they traverse the stones and reach the house. The house looks beaten and 
worn down despite its festive purple hue. The front entrance way is 
covered in wooden boards and cloth. They find a broken hole in the side 
of the brick wall with a green curtain draped over it, and use it to get 
into the house. They enter an empty space with a raised platform in the 
center. Sora hears a voice behind him and whirls around)

Kairi: There’s something about this musty place...

(Kairi walks slowly through the room, holding her hands behind her back)

Kairi: It reminds me of the secret place back home, where we used to 
scribble on the walls. Remember?

(She looks toward him and smiles)

Sora: Kairi?

Goofy: Sora?

(He turns to see a concerned Donald and Goofy before looking back to Kairi, 
who has vanished completely)

??????: Well, well.

(They look over to the entrance curtain and see an old wizard in blue 
robes with an extremely long beard. He is carrying a carpet bag and a wand)

??????: You’ve arrived sooner than I expected.

Sora: Wha... You knew we were coming?

??????: Of course.

Sora: Are you...a Heartless?

Donald: He doesn’t look like one.

??????: Oh, my. No. My name is Merlin. As you can see, I am a sorcerer. I 
spend much of my time traveling. It’s good to be home. Your king has 
requested my help.

Goofy: King Mickey?

Merlin: Yes, indeed. Donald, Goofy. And who might you be, young man?

Sora: I’m Sora.

Merlin: Ah. So, you have found the key.

Donald: What did the king ask you to do?

Merlin: Just a moment...

(He walks up to the stairs and sets down his carpet bag before reaching 
the center of the raised platform. He lifts his wand high in the air)

Merlin: Presto!

(Dust flies around the carpet bag as it opens and out pops teapots, tables, 
drawers, and chairs, small at first, but quickly growing larger. The wacky 
wizard dances around while waving his wand, directing the items from the 
bag to their respective places in the house. Soon after, the room is 
entirely furnished, complete with bed, desk, and multiple piles of books)

Merlin: There, now. Ahem.

(He turns to face Sora)

Merlin: Your king asked me to train you in the art of magic. We can start 
anytime you like. Let me know when you’re ready to begin the training. Oh, 
and one more thing.

(He turns to the entrance where a small model of a royal carriage is 
placed on the floor next to the telescope in the open window. Magic 
sparkles in the air coalesce at the carriage’s place and form an elderly 
woman in blue robes with a pink bow around her neck. She wears her hood 
over her white hair and holds up a long magic wand. She smiles at them 
sweetly)

?????: Hello. I’m the Fairy Godmother. Your king asked me to help, too. I 
will assist throughout your journey.

Merlin: I do not know how much I can be of help, but do stop by anytime.

(Sora hands him the book)

Merlin: Oh, that book... So, Cid asked you to bring this. Thank you. You 
wish to know what kind of book it is? I don’t even know, myself. In fact, 
it’s not mine. Somehow it found its way into my bag one day. It was such 
a curious book, I asked Cid to repair it for me. Well, I guess I’ll put it 
here somewhere, for now. This book holds a great secret. The missing pages 
will unlock it.

(He points to a small bedside table)

Merlin: I’ll leave the book over there. Do look at it whenever you like. My 
best regards to Cid for repairing it for me. Oh, and about that stone of 
yours... You should ask the Fairy Godmother about that.

(They speak to the Fairy Godmother and show her Leon’s stone)

Sora: Do you know what this is?

Fairy Godmother: Oh, the poor thing! He has turned into a summon gem.

Sora: A summon gem?

Fairy Godmother: This little creature lived in a world that was consumed 
by darkness. When a world vanishes, so do its inhabitants. But this one 
has such a strong heart, he became a gem instead of vanishing with his world.

Sora: Can he regain himself?

Fairy Godmother: Yes, but only his spirit. Now, watch!

(She waves her wand)

Fairy Godmother: Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

(Sora is granted the power to summon Simba)

Fairy Godmother: Whenever you call, he will help you. If you find any 
more of these, bring them to me. Don’t worry, when their worlds are 
restored they will return there. Sora, please help save them.

Sora: Don’t worry, I will.

(Sora opens the old book on the nightstand and with a flash, he lands on 
its pages. A house of sticks appears on the map and he runs over to it, 
entering an empty meadow. He walks up to a large log, where a stuffed toy 
bear wearing a small red shirt is seated, tapping his forehead)

????: Think, think. Think, think.

Sora: Hi there. What’s wrong?

????: Nothing. Just thinking.

Sora: Oh.

????: I was thinking of how to say goodbye to Pooh.

Sora: Pooh?

Pooh (answering): Yes?

Sora (sitting beside him): Wait a second. You’re Pooh?

Pooh: Yes, I’m Winnie the Pooh. Pooh for short. Who are you?

Sora: I’m Sora.

Pooh: Oh. Hello, Sora. Have you come to say goodbye to Pooh, too?

(His face turns sad)

Sora: Well, no. Why would I do that? We’ve only just met.

Pooh: Because everyone’s gone away.

Sora: What do you mean?

Pooh: Well, we all lived here in the Hundred Acre Wood. And we’d take 
walks together, or play Pooh sticks... And every day, I’d eat some honey. 
Just one small smackeral would taste very good right now.

(He rubs his tummy)

Pooh: But now everyone’s gone. All my friends, and my favorite Hunny 
Tree too. Everyone must’ve gone away while I was napping, I think... So, 
who knows?

(He hops off the log)

Pooh: Maybe I shall end up going away somewhere as well. But I wonder, 
how do I say goodbye to myself?

(He puts his hands on his head)

Pooh: Think, think, think.

(Sora stares at him)

Pooh: Oh, my tumbly is getting rather rumbly.

(Sora watches him walk off. He follows the bear to a house built into a 
tree. Above the door of the house is hung an odd sign reading “MR. SANDERZ” 
with a backwards N. Next to it is a bell with a misspelled note reading 
“Rnig also”. Sora enters the house, seeing Pooh gazing inside a honey pot)

Pooh: Oh, bother. There’s no more honey left. If only the Hunny Tree 
would visit... Then I could eat my fill.

(He stands up and leaves the house. Sora follows, being greeted outside 
by an owl)

Owl: Let me guess: You’d like to know what happens next. Unfortunately, 
some of the pages are missing, so I can’t tell you yet. The pages are 
scattered over many worlds. Would you find them for us?

(Sora exits the storybook and regroups with Donald and Goofy in Merlin’s 
Study)

Merlin: You’d best go see Cid before going anywhere else.

(They leave the Mystical House and return to the Third District. Soldier 
Heartless appear, but they are taken out by someone with a sharp-looking 
sword. Sora looks incredibly surprised to see...)

Riku: There you are. What’s going on?

Sora: Riku!

(He walks up to Riku and stretches his mouth out, making sure he’s real)

Riku: Hey, hey, cut it out.

Sora: I’m not dreaming this time, right?

Riku: I hope not. Took forever to find you.

(He runs a hand through his finger as Sora smiles)

Sora: Riku!

(Riku smiles back and they start walking through the square)

Sora: Wait a second, where’s Kairi?

Riku: Isn’t she with you?

(Sora looks down, sadly)

Riku: Well, don’t worry. I’m sure she made it off the island, too.

(He looks to the sky)

Riku: We’re finally free. Hey, she might even be looking for us now.

(A Shadow Heartless emerges from the ground, its antennae wriggling wildly. 
Riku is faced away from everyone)

Riku: We’ll all be together again soon. Don’t worry. Just leave everything 
to me. I know this—

(He hears a noise behind him, and turns to see Sora, who has just destroyed 
the Shadow Heartless. Sora stands and tosses the Keyblade over his shoulder)

Sora (proudly): Leave it to who?

Riku (walking closer): Sora, what did you—

Sora: I’ve been looking for you and Kairi, too, with their help.

(Donald and Goofy nod, but Riku looks apprehensive)

Riku: Who are they?

Donald: Ahem. My name is—

Sora: We’ve visited so many places and worlds, looking for you.

Riku: Really? Well, what do you know? I never would have guessed.

(Goofy puts his hands on Sora’s shoulders)

Goofy: Oh, and guess what? Sora’s the Keyblade master.

Donald: Who would’ve thought it?

Sora (stomping his foot): What’s that mean?

Riku: So, this is called a Keyblade?

(Riku holds up Sora’s Keyblade)

Sora: Huh?

(He looks at his own hand in confusion)

Sora: Hey, give it back.

(He rushes forward to grab it, but Riku moves back and Sora stumbles and 
falls over. Riku holds the Keyblade above his head, getting a good look 
at it)

Riku: Catch!

Sora: Whoa!

(He tosses it to Sora, who stands up quickly)

Sora: Okay, so you’re coming with us, right? We’ve got this awesome rocket. 
Wait ‘til you see it!

Donald (rudely): No, he can’t come!

Sora (stomping his foot again): What?

Donald: Forget it!

Sora: Oh, come on! He’s my friend!

Donald: I don’t care!

(The argument catches Goofy’s attention, but when he looks back at Riku, 
he sees no one)

Goofy: Huh? He’s gone.

(Sora looks around the District, seeing nobody)

Sora: Riku?

(He walks slowly)

Sora: Nice going. Oh, well. At least, he’s okay.

(He puts his hands behind his head, hopeful)

Sora: And who knows? Maybe we’ll run into Kairi soon, too.

(They walk up the stairs to the Small House, seeing the lights on in 
the window and enter to find Cid, Leon, Yuffie, and Aerith inside. Boxes 
are stacked up against the wall and a lantern hangs from the ceiling)

Cid: You guys ever hear of Maleficent?

(Sora shakes his head as Leon leans against the wall)

Cid: I hear she’s in town.

Sora: Who is she?

Cid: A witch, man, she’s a witch!

Leon: She’s the reason this town is full of Heartless. Don’t take her 
lightly.

Aerith: She’s been using the Heartless for years.

Leon: We lost our world, thanks to her.

Cid: One day, a swarm of Heartless took over our world!

Leon: That was nine years ago.

Cid: I got out of that mess and came here with these guys.

Donald: That’s awful!

Leon: Our ruler was a wise man named Ansem. He dedicated his life to 
studying the Heartless.

Cid: His report should tell us how to get rid of the Heartless.

Sora: Where’s this report?

Leon: We don’t know. It got scattered when our world was destroyed.

Cid: I’m sure Maleficent’s got most of the pages.

(Outside, Maleficent stands with Riku, gazing at them through the 
windows of the house)

Maleficent: You see? It’s just as I told you. While you toiled away 
trying to find your dear friend, he quite simply replaced you with 
some new companions. Evidently, now he values them far more than he 
does you.

(She looks down at Riku as he stares with narrow, unblinking eyes)

Maleficent: You’re better off without that wretched boy.

(She bends down to his level, giving him a smile)

Maleficent: Now, think no more of him and come with me. I’ll help you 
find what you’re searching for...

(In the Small House, they carry on their conversation)

Cid: So, you delivered that book? That navigation gummi’s installed 
and ready to go. You find another one, you bring it to me. I threw in 
a warp gummi for the heck of it. Now you can jump to worlds you’ve been 
to before. Well, better get back to my real job. What’s my real job? 
You’ll see. See me at the First District.

Aerith: I’ve been thinking about the bell in the Second District.

Sora: That one that rang a bit ago?

Yuffie: The one above the gizmo shop. There’s a legend about it, you know.

Aerith: But it’s all boarded up. Nobody can get in there.

Cid: Heck, go check it out. Ring it three times to see if anything happens.

(They leave and enter the Second District, battling Heartless on their 
way to the roof of the Gizmo Shop. They take down the wooden boards of 
the bell tower and Sora rings the bell)

(The mural in the fountain in the square below changes and the empty 
fountain fills with flames. Sora rings it again and the mural changes 
once more, the fire dissipating and the lights above the fountain blink 
on. When the bell tolls the third time, the lights shut off and water 
spurts out of the fountain, the mural changing finally to butterflies 
surrounding a flower, which then reveals a large Keyhole. They jump down 
to the square and approach the fountain when the Guard Armor drops from 
the sky. Sora begins attacking the torso of the Heartless while Donald 
and Goofy go after its legs. It spins its arms wildly and with a few more 
hits, it crashes to the ground, motionless. The trio pauses, watching as 
the armor twitches. It reforms its body and falls forward, its arms digging 
into the ground. Its torso and legs flip over, and the toes of its hammer-
like feet curve inwards, forming hands. Its helmet opens and its yellow 
eyes stare blankly at them. It lunges forward and meets the blade in Sora’s 
hands. The Opposite Armor continues to tackle them, floating in midair. The 
Heartless soon splits itself in half, the helmet and arms going after Sora, 
and the feet and torso find their targets in Donald and Goofy. Donald 
summons a Thunder spell, sending bolts of electricity into the armor. The 
helmet swirls around between the arms, almost taunting them, before its 
body reforms. It moves to tackle them again, but mid-tackle, Sora strikes, 
knocking its parts everywhere. Nearly defenseless, they destroy its 
appendages, leaving just the torso and helmet. It turns its torso sideways, 
staring at them with its glowing eyes. A ball of energy shoots out from 
inside it, and it targets Sora, who dodges away. Another ball of energy 
shoots out, and this time Sora is ready for it. He blocks with his Keyblade, 
sending the orb back to the Opposite Armor, which begins to shake violently. 
The helmet falls inside its torso and a large glowing heart floats out 
into the sky, before the armor disappears. Sora walks over to the shining 
Keyhole, and locks it. The Keyhole shimmers and breaks off, disintegrating 
into pieces, leaving only the butterfly mural and a gummi block. Sora, 
Donald, and Goofy return to the First District and meet Cid behind the 
Accessory Shop)

Cid: Hey, now that was quick! Now you know. I’m in the gummi block 
business. Workin’ on your gummi ship sure was great. Come again and I’ll 
give you a big discount.

(He gives them a gummi block)

Cid: Go ahead, take it. It’s a special giveaway.

(They show him the gummi block they found at the Keyhole)

Cid: Hey, got another navigation gummi there, eh? I’ll bet you want it 
installed.

Sora: Yeah, please.

Cid: Hmm... Looks like this is another one of those blocks that come in 
sets. You gotta find the mate to this one.

(He returns the gummi block to them and they enter the Accessory Shop, 
seeing a small boy on the floor near the counter. Jiminy Cricket jumps 
onto Sora’s shoulder)

Jiminy: Well, well, as I live and breathe! If it isn’t Pinocchio!

(The cricket hops down to the boy and Sora is surprised to see that he 
is entirely made of wood)

Pinocchio (looking up): Oh. Hi, Jiminy.

Jiminy: What in the world are you doing down here?

Pinocchio (thinking): Um... Playing hide-and-seek.

(Jiminy starts pacing around)

Jiminy: I just don’t believe it. And here I was, up all night, just 
worried sick about you. Why of all the—

(He looks up at Pinocchio, shocked)

Jiminy: Pinocchio!

(Pinocchio stares at his nose, which has magically grown longer)

Jiminy (sternly): Pinocchio! Are you telling me the truth?

Pinocchio: Yes!

Jiminy: Then tell me, what is this?

(He points to an item on the floor beside them)

Pinocchio: It was a present.

Jiminy: No fibbing, now! You know you’re not supposed to tell lies. A lie 
only grows and grows, ‘til you get caught! Plain as the nose on your face!

Pinocchio: But if you want something, why wait? Why not just take it?

Jiminy: Oh, my! Who told you that? You need some advice from your conscience!

Pinocchio: That’s right! You’re my conscience, Jiminy! I’ll never tell 
lies as long as you’re around.

(Magic surrounds Pinocchio’s nose and it shrinks to its normal size)

Jiminy: You need to be good so you can become a real boy. You promised 
Geppetto you would be, right?

Pinocchio: Oh! Do you know where Father is?

Jiminy: He’s not with you?

Pinocchio: Jiminy, let’s go find Father!

Jiminy: Now, hold on! There are all sorts of dangers and temptations out 
there! I’ll go find Geppetto, so you just wait here. These fellows here 
will be helping me.

Sora: We will?

(Pinocchio stands up)

Jiminy: Well, shall we go, Sora?

Sora: You could’ve asked us first...

(They leave Traverse Town and travel to Olympus Coliseum, where they 
compete in the Phil Cup. After making their way up the tournament, they 
speak to Phil and Hercules)

Philoctetes: I never thought you’d do it. Not bad.

Hercules: Phil, you’re just as stubborn as ever. Don’t pretend you’re 
not happy for them!

Philoctetes: Ahem! Now, kid, you’ve still got a long way to go. The next 
round’s startin’ soon. Next time it’ll be the real thing.

(They leave for the world of Agrabah, where a tall, thin man in robes 
walks through the streets with Maleficent)

Maleficent: And the Keyhole?

?????: The Heartless are searching for it now. I’m certain we’ll find 
it soon enough. So that just leaves...

(Overhead, a brightly-colored parrot squawks through the air loudly 
before circling down to land on the man’s pointed shoulders)

Iago: Jafar! I’ve looked everywhere for Jasmine. She’s disappeared like 
magic!

Jafar: The girl is more trouble than she’s worth.

Maleficent: You said you had things under control.

Jafar: Agrabah is full of holes for rats to hide in. But why worry 
about Princess Jasmine? With her or without her, surely this world will 
be ours when we find the Keyhole.

Maleficent: We need all seven princesses of heart to open the final 
door. Any fewer is useless.

Jafar: Well, if the princess is that important, we’ll find her.

(Bandit Heartless appear behind him, brandishing swords)

Jafar: Find Jasmine and bring her to me at once.

(The Heartless follow Iago through the streets)

Maleficent: Don’t steep yourself in darkness too long. The Heartless 
consume the careless.

(Jafar laughs proudly)

Jafar: Your concern is touching, but hardly necessary.

(Behind Maleficent in a watermelon stand, a worried young woman 
overhears their conversation. She is no commoner, as her jewelry and 
her clothes are obviously expensive. Sora, Donald, and Goofy arrive 
in the Plaza to find Heartless roaming the streets of Agrabah. They 
take out the Heartless as they make their way into an Alley. Sora gasps, 
when he sees someone staring at them from behind a pile of crates)

???????: Who’s there? Hello?

(The girl comes out of hiding and speaks to them)

???????: I’m Jasmine. My father is the sultan of Agrabah.

Goofy: Uh... So that makes you a princess.

Jasmine: But he has been deposed by Jafar, who now controls the city.

Goofy: Jafar?

Jasmine: You haven’t heard of him? He’s the royal vizier. He’s gained 
evil powers and seized Agrabah. He’s desperately looking for something—
something he calls the “Keyhole.” Jafar caught me trying to escape, but 
he helped me.

Sora: Who helped you?

Jasmine: We were hiding nearby, but he left a while ago to take care of 
something... Oh, I hope Aladdin’s all right.

Jafar: Aladdin? Where might I find this street rat?

(They look up to see Jafar on a high ledge)

Jafar: Jasmine, allow me to find you more suitable company, my dear 
princess. These little rats won’t do, you see.

Sora: Jasmine, run!

(Jasmine runs into the city and the three reveal their weapons)

Jafar: Ah, the boy who holds the key.

(Jafar summons Heartless, who drop down and attack them as Jafar 
escapes. They defeat the Heartless and walk through Main Street, 
finding an entrance to a loft. Inside the loft, they find an ornate 
rug trying to pull itself out from under a chest of drawers. They 
move it off of the rug, who stands in front of them on two tassels 
and bows in gratitude, before magically flying out the open hole in 
the wall)

Donald: The carpet flew off toward the desert. Let’s follow it, Sora!

(They make their way to the vast desert, sand and sky as far as the 
eye can see. The magic carpet flies towards them and lands. It motions 
for them to come along, and they ride it to a sandpit, where a young 
man and his pet monkey are trapped in the sand. A horde of Heartless 
appears and they are forced to fight them before reaching the young man. 
More Heartless surround them)

Goofy: Gawrsh, not again!

(The man manages to get himself free, pulling out a rather old and 
dirty oil lamp)

Aladdin: Genie, get rid of these guys!

(He rubs the lamp and holds it into the air. Magic sparks appear from the 
lamp followed by blue smoke, and a large genie erupts from it with a yell)

Genie: Wish Number One, coming right up!

(He snaps his fingers and the Heartless vanish around them. Later, they 
stand in the desert as the magic carpet flies overhead)

Aladdin: I see... Thanks, Sora.

Sora: Aladdin, what’re you doing out here?

Aladdin: Same old stuff. Hunting legendary treasure. Just paid a visit 
to the Cave of Wonders.

(The carpet lands)

Aladdin: I found that magic carpet, and this lamp.

(He shows them the lamp)

Aladdin: Legend has it that whoever holds the lamp can summon the—

Genie: Please, kid, leave the intros to a professional. (winking) The 
one and only GENIE OF THE LAMP!

(He rubs the lamp)

Genie: Rub-a-dub-dub the lamp and have your dearest wishes granted.

(He bows and flies over to Aladdin)

Genie: Today’s winner is...Aladdin! Congratulations!

(Genie makes confetti rain down on him and shakes his hand)

Donald: Any wish?

Genie: Patience, my fine feathered friend.

(He splits into three genies, each holding up three fingers)

Genie: Any three wishes ! A one wish (one genie disappears), a two wish 
(two disappear), a three wish. Then I make like a banana and split!

(The third disappears)

Genie: Our lucky winner made his first wish—

(He reappears next to Sora)

Genie (aside): And let me tell you, what a doozy that wish was—

(He split into two back-to-back genies)

Genie (echoing): So he has two left.

(He pops out and zooms back in, turning his smoky tail into a microphone)

Genie: So, master, what’ll you have for Wish Number Two?

(He spins and drops a spotlight on Aladdin, who puts a hand on his chin)

Aladdin: Hmm, how about making me a fabulously wealthy prince?

Genie: Oooh! Money! Royalty! Fame!

(He pinches the air and bows)

Genie: Okay, you asked for it! A hundred servants and a hundred camels 
loaded with gold!

(He starts dialing on an imaginary phone, holding his hand up to his ear)

Genie: Just say the word and I’ll deliver it in 30 minutes or less, or 
your meal’s free.

(He flies over to Aladdin, putting an arm around his shoulder)

Genie: Hey, I’ll even throw in a cappuccino!

Aladdin (chuckling): No, thanks!

Genie: Okay.

Aladdin: I think I’ll put that on hold until we reach Agrabah.

Goofy: Uh, why a prince?

Aladdin: You see, there’s this girl in Agrabah named Jasmine. But she’s 
a princess, and I’m... Aww, she could never fall for a guy like me.

(He looks toward the sand)

Donald: Oh. Princess?

Goofy: Jasmine?

Sora: Oh, that’s right! She’s in trouble, Aladdin!

Aladdin: What? Well, c’mon, let’s get going!

(They board the magic carpet, and start flying back to Agrabah. Genie 
flies alongside them)

Genie: Ah, fresh air! The great outdoors!

Sora: I guess you don’t get out much, huh?

Genie: Comes with the job. Phenomenal cosmic powers. Itty-bitty living 
space. It’s always three wishes, then back to my portable prison. I’m 
lucky to see the light of day every century or two...

Aladdin: Say, Genie, what if I use my last wish to free you from the 
lamp? What do you think?

Genie (smiling): You’d do that?

Aladdin: Genie, it’s a promise. After we help Jasmine.

(They fly to the city and enter Aladdin’s House)

Aladdin: So, Jafar is after Jasmine and this “Keyhole.”

Genie: Keyhole, eh? I could swear I’ve heard about that somewhere before...

Donald: Really? Where?

Genie: Now, where was it? It’s only been 200 years...

Sora: Well, anyway, we’ve got to stop Jafar before it’s too late.

(They enter the Palace Gates by way of a high ledge and see Jafar 
standing at the gates with Princess Jasmine. They jump down to their 
level, alerting the vizier to their presence)

Jafar: Setting your sights a little high, aren’t you boy? Back to 
your hole, street rat. I will not allow you to trouble the princess 
any more.

Aladdin (shouting): Jasmine!

Jasmine: I’m so sorry, Aladdin.

(Jafar holds out an arm to block her, while Aladdin pulls out the 
lamp behind his back)

Aladdin (rubbing the lamp): Genie, help Jasmine, please!

(Jafar turns and his eyes grow wide, seeing Genie carrying Jasmine)

Genie (cheerfully): One wish left! You’re making this really easy, you know.

Jafar (smirking): So sorry, boy. I’m afraid your second wish has been denied.

(Iago flies over to Jafar with the lamp. Aladdin looks at his hand, 
seeing it empty, and knocks the cap off his head in shock. Iago gives 
Jafar the lamp)

Genie: I’m sorry, Al.

(He disappears and Jasmine falls through the air with a scream, landing 
in a clay pot which suddenly grows legs)

Jafar: And now, I bid you all farewell. Attack!

(Jafar disappears as two pots explode behind them, revealing the front 
and back of a Heartless. Sora attacks the front head, and its antennae 
light up with a burst of electricity. It swings them around wildly, 
striking Sora in the face. He reels back as Aladdin searches around for 
Jasmine, who is desperately calling out for help among the clay pots. 
Several of the numerous pots have grown legs and are walking around the 
area towards the large Heartless. Sora watches as the Pot Spiders join 
with the head and tail, becoming a Pot Centipede, which begins to walk 
toward the desert, gathering more Pot Spiders and growing bigger. Jasmine’s 
cries become fainter and they run after the Pot Centipede, searching for 
the princess within its body. As it races away from them, its tail bursts 
with darkness)

Sora: Courage!

(He holds a hand to his heart, summoning with all his might. He gathers 
energy on the end of his Keyblade and thrusts it into the air, magic 
swirling around him. Up from the ground comes a large figure with glowing 
eyes. It steps forward and its golden fur and large mane come into view. 
The lion gives off a mighty roar, which fills the air. Simba jumps toward 
the Pot Centipede and bellows, sending various Pot Spiders shattering. 
When one pot is left, the Centipede gathers it up and starts to run faster. 
Aladdin races after it and with Sora’s help, the Pot Centipede is 
defeated. Aladdin runs at it, but it disappears, leaving nothing)

Aladdin: Jasmine!

(They hear an evil laugh emanating from the desert)

Aladdin: To the desert! Come on, let’s move!

(They take the Magic Carpet to the Desert. Suddenly, something bursts 
out of the sand, spinning violently toward them. It lands two giant feet 
on the ground, clawing at carpet, who dodges frantically as Sora grits 
his teeth. The four of them topple out of the carpet as Kurt Zisa turns 
its six-armed body in their direction, summoning two orbs of energy in 
its hands. The orb cancel their magic summoning abilities and Sora moves 
in to attack its feet. As it walks closer to them, the mechanical crunch 
echoing through the desert, it stares at them with its snake-like head. 
Two of its other arms hold long curved scythes, which is spins wildly, 
slicing at them. Sora and Aladdin eliminate the magic-cancelling orbs and 
Donald sends a Thunder spell, sending it falling to the ground. It’s head 
rears up out of its body on a long elastic neck, attempting to bite them, 
before it jumps back up, summoning large dust devils, tossing sand 
everywhere. Goofy charges it with his shield, but misses as it spins 
through the air toward Sora. Donald heals him as it sends fireballs toward 
them. With several more critical strikes, Kurt Zisa stumbles forward. They 
run away from it as its arms crash down in the sand around them. Aladdin 
summons the Magic Carpet and it swoops down to grab them as the Heartless 
falls over completely. A large glowing heart rises up into the sky as they 
fly away towards the end of the desert, watching as the Heartless vanishes 
in the distance. They reach the sandpit where they found Aladdin earlier 
and dismount from the carpet. They step forward and the sand in front of 
them lurches upward. The ground quakes as an enormous tiger head heaves 
out of the sand. Its mouth opens, heat and flame emanating from its depths, 
and its eyes glow. An evil glow, one of dark purpose. They approach its 
mouth before it reels upward, blasting them with a hot torrent of sand. 
Heartless appear and they realize the tiger head is under their control. 
Sora begins thrashing at the Heartless before a beam of energy strikes 
Aladdin in the back, knocking him over. Donald heals him and Sora sees 
that the beams are coming from its eyes. After he destroys a few 
Heartless, the tiger head buries its mouth in the sand, and Sora jumps 
onto its nose, because it releases a spray of sand from its mouth. Sora 
attacks its eyes before a Bandit Heartless flips onto the top of the 
tiger, almost knocking Sora off. Goofy climbs up the side of the tiger 
head and shields Sora from more flying Heartless. Sora continues 
striking the eyes until the power of darkness is driven from the Cave 
of Wonders. Once everything settles down, they enter the cave. Fighting 
Heartless through the labyrinthine halls of the Cave of Wonders, they 
drop down to a watery level and Sora destroys a pillar with a Fire spell. 
Meanwhile, in the Lamp Chamber, Jafar stands next to an enslaved Genie 
as Jasmine lies unconscious on the stone floor. Jafar taps his snake 
staff on the ground and holds up the magic lamp)

Jafar: My first wish, Genie! Show me the Keyhole!

(Genie looks over, despondently, and snaps his fingers. The rock wall 
bursts open, revealing pillars and a Keyhole beyond. Jafar cackles 
evilly. Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Aladdin make their way past the 
Treasure Room and into the Lamp Chamber, where they find Jafar speaking 
with Maleficent)

Maleficent: That boy again?

Jafar: He’s more persistent than I expected. Why not explain the 
situation to that boy Riku? Doing so may actually prove useful to our--

(He is distracted by footsteps, and turns to see Sora and company arrive)

Sora: Wait a second. Are you Maleficent?

(The witch vanishes without a word)

Aladdin: Jafar, let Jasmine go!

Jafar: Not a chance.

(She lies at his feet in front of the Keyhole)

Jafar: You see, she’s a princess—one of seven who somehow hold the key 
to opening the door.

Goofy: Open...

Donald: ...the door?

Jafar: But you fools won’t live to see what lies beyond it. Genie! My 
second wish. Crush them!

(Aladdin gasps as Genie hangs in the air)

Aladdin: Genie, no!

Genie: Sorry, Al. The one with the lamp calls the shots. I don’t have 
a choice.

(Jafar lifts his snake staff into the air, and its eyes glow, creating 
a magic barrier around the room, blocking the exit and the Keyhole. Jafar 
begins chanting a spell and he sends a beam of heat from his staff at 
them. Aladdin runs forward and attacks Jafar, who teleports to a platform 
on the other edge of the room as Genie floats toward them)

Genie: I’m really sorry about this. Run!

(He swipes at them, but they dodge his attacks and follow Jafar. Sora 
catches up and begins thrashing with his Keyblade, causing Genie to cheer. 
Jafar chants another spell, causing a giant hailstorm in the center of 
the room, trapping Donald and Goofy. Aladdin strikes from behind while 
Jafar is distracted and the vizier pulses with energy. Lightning crackles 
around him and he screams. Aladdin runs over to Jasmine, but before he 
can reach her, Jafar gets an idea)

Jafar: Genie!

(They turn to see Jafar floating in the center of the room, holding up 
the magic lamp)

Jafar: My final wish! I want you to make me and all-powerful genie!

(Genie covers his eyes and looks away, pointing his finger at Jafar and 
releasing as small amount of wish energy as possible. It strikes Jafar, 
who begins to glow and the floor crumbles beneath him, revealing a large 
pool of lava surrounding stone platforms. Jafar descends towards the 
pool and they stare down into the frightening, gaping maw. They jump 
down into the cavern, searching around for Jafar, when suddenly he bursts 
out of the lava with a great laugh. He gazes down at them evilly in his 
red genie form, brimming with power and malice. Iago flies by them, holding 
a coal black lamp)

Aladdin: The lamp! Get Jafar’s lamp!

Jafar: Iago! Keep the lamp away from them!

Iago: Yeah, yeah, I hear you!

(Jafar begins throwing molten rocks at them as they go after Iago)

Iago: Nag, nag! It’s all he ever does!

(The air is dense with heat, making it hard to breathe. They corner 
Iago on a faraway platform as Jafar rises up to meet them. Sora sends 
a Blizzara spell at him, but he shrugs it off)

Iago: Ugh! Is it hot in here, or is it just me?

(After attacking Iago for a while, the bird lands)

Iago: Water! Water!

Jafar: Keep moving!

(Jafar heals Iago)

Iago: I don’t need your help, all right!

(Iago takes back the lamp and continues flying around with it. The 
platforms rise higher, allowing them to knock the lamp away from the 
bird. It drops to the ground and Sora grabs it)

Sora: Okay, Jafar! Back to your lamp!

(He holds it up and Jafar screams as magic whips around him, pulling 
him into the magic lamp. Jasmine watches from above, before hearing 
footsteps behind her. She turns around slowly and is taken. The magic 
carpet brings Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Aladdin back to the Keyhole, 
but Jasmine is nowhere to be found)

Aladdin: Jasmine? Jasmine!

(The Keyhole glows in the presence of the Keyblade and Sora seals it. 
Magic swirls around the Keyhole and a curtain of gold sparkles covers 
it with a loud locking sound. The cave begins to rumble and Goofy covers 
his head with his shield)

Goofy: Whoa, we’d better get out of here!

Aladdin: Jasmine!

(They pull Aladdin onto the magic carpet and it speeds them out of 
the Cave of Wonders. They fly back to Aladdin’s House)

Aladdin: So, Jasmine’s no longer in Agrabah. Sora, let’s go find her.

Sora (sadly): Sorry. I can’t take you with me.

Aladdin: Wh-Why not?

(Aladdin sits down)

Goofy: I sure wish we could...

Donald: But we can’t. If we take him to another world, we would be...

Goofy: Muh... Mudd—

Donald: Meddling!

Sora: Aladdin, we’ll find Jasmine. I promise.

Genie (patting Aladdin’s back): Uh, earth to Al. Hello? You still have 
one wish left. Look, just say the word. Ask me to find Jasmine for you.

Aladdin: I...I wish...

(Genie rolls up his imaginary sleeves)

Aladdin: For your freedom, Genie.

Genie (surprised): Al!

(Magic swirls around Genie, who’s smoky tail splits into two legs, and 
the golden cuffs on his wrists disappear)

Aladdin: A deal’s a deal, Genie. Now you can go anywhere you want. You’re 
your own master. But if you can, it’d be great if you could go along with 
them and help Sora find Jasmine.

(Genie turns away, crossing his arms)

Genie: Sorry, Al. I’m done taking orders from others. But... A favor, 
now that’s entirely different.

(He looks back at him, smiling brightly)

Genie: I guess I could give that a try.

(He leaps over, putting a hand on Aladdin’s shoulder)

Genie: After all, we’re pals, right, Al?

Aladdin: Genie...

Genie (smiling): Just leave it to me!

(Aladdin runs a hand through his hair and chuckles. Meanwhile, in a dark 
chapel, Maleficent and Hades stand around a table. Hades sighs as 
Maleficent faces away from them)

Hades: That smarmy vizier could’ve had ‘em—if someone had stuck around 
to give him a hand.

(He looks over at Riku, who glances back at him with narrowed eyes)

Riku: Hey, I did my part. I brought the princess, didn’t I?

Maleficent: Jafar was beyond help, consumed by his own hatred. One 
should beware of letting it burn too fiercely.

Hades: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lighten up. I’m as cool as they come, okay? 
By the way, kid, have we got something special for you.

Riku: Huh?

(Riku looks toward Maleficent)

Maleficent: We had a deal, yes? You help us, and we grant you your wish...

(An image of Kairi appears on the table)

Riku: Kairi!

Maleficent: Go to her. Your vessel is waiting.

(A man walks in wearing pirate’s robes and a large feathered cap. He holds 
up a hook for a hand, smirking)

????: Just remember, this is no pleasure cruise. It won’t be a pleasant 
voyage.

Riku (to Maleficent): Why are you doing all this for me? What’s the catch?

Maleficent (turning to face him): Catch? What’s the catch?

(She bends down to him, placing a hand on his cheek)

Maleficent: Silly, boy. You’re like a son to me. I only want you to be happy.

(He knocks her hand away)

Riku: I seriously doubt that.

Maleficent: Believe what you wish. But lest we forget, I kept my end of 
the bargain.

(He stares at her before walking towards the pirate. Back in Agrabah, 
Sora speaks to Aladdin)

Aladdin: Here. Take this with you.

(He gives Sora a keychain)

Aladdin: Sora, please find Jasmine for me.

(They return to the gummi ship) 

Sora: Could this torn page be from Merlin’s book?

Goofy: Let’s return to town and give it to him.

(They return to Merlin’s Study and Sora enters the 100 Acre Wood. He 
finds a tall, curious tree buzzing with bees)

??????: Hello, i-is anyone there?

(From inside a log nearby, a small piglet walks out, looking around nervously)

??????: Wh-Wh-What am I to do? I’m all alone. (calling) Pooh? Pooh? Where 
are you? It’s me, Piglet.

(He turns around and a shadow creeps over him. He looks up to see Sora 
towering over him and runs away behind the tree. He peeks out from its 
trunk, checking to see if Sora is gone. Sora sneaks up behind him and 
he stands frozen in place, completely terrified)

Piglet: Oh dear! I was j-just... N-Never mind. I’m sorry!

(Piglet closes his eyes and Sora kneels down to his level)

Sora: Don’t be scared. You’re looking for Pooh, right?

Piglet: You know Pooh?

(He sighs with relief)

Piglet: Oh, y-you see, I-I have something for him. I have to take it to 
Pooh right away!

(He turns, seeing Winnie the Pooh walking towards the tree)

Piglet (calling): Oh, Pooh!

(He runs to meet the bear, who begins sniffing the air, smiling)

Pooh: Oh, I believe I smell a delicious something—a something like honey!

Piglet: Pooh!

(Piglet meets him in front of the tree)

Pooh: Hello, Piglet. How have you been?

Piglet: Oh, I-I’m so glad to see you. I thought you’d gone away. I 
brought wh-what you asked for.

(He gives Pooh a blue balloon)

Pooh: Thank you, Piglet. Now I can finally have some honey.

Piglet: Really? B-But how?

Pooh: I shall hold on to the balloon, and fly like a bee up the Hunny 
Tree, see.

Piglet: But if you take their honey, won’t the bees be angry?

Pooh: Hmm...

(He stares at the balloon, thinking)

Pooh: Oh!

(Sora walks over to them)

Pooh: If you could only chase away those bees, I’m quite certain I 
could get a small morsel of honey. Would you help me get some honey?

Sora: Sure!

(Owl lands on a branch above them)

Pooh: Oh. Hello there, Owl.

Owl: Good day, Pooh. What are you doing? Using a balloon to get some 
honey? Splendid idea! Allow me to offer a few pointers.

(He flies to a higher branch)

Owl: Ahem! Now, Pooh can get honey by floating up this tree with his 
balloon. The honey is inside the tree hollows, not the beehives you 
see here.

(He flies to an even higher branch)

Owl: There’s quite a lot of honey in these holes. If Pooh gets too 
close, the bees will come out to protect their honey. If they get to 
Pooh, they’ll pop his balloon. Lock onto the bees and swat them away. 
The more time Pooh has at each hollow, the more honey he can eat. There’s 
more honey higher up, too. If jumping from branch to branch proves 
difficult, try the Rush command. Rush can help you catch up to Pooh 
quickly. But it isn’t fully reliable. Good luck.

(Sora helps toss Pooh into the air and he floats up the tree, gathering 
honey. Sora swats away the bees that attack, letting Pooh enjoy his 
meal. Pooh grabs handfuls of honey in his mouth from inside the tree)

Pooh (giggling): It is rather funny what I will do for honey.

(Sora leaves the 100 Acre Wood with a summon gem in hand. He gives it 
to the Fairy Godmother)

Fairy Godmother: Oh, another summon gem? Let’s help this little one. Here 
we go! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

(Sora is granted the power to summon Bambi)

Fairy Godmother: If you find any more of these stones, bring them to me.

(The leave Traverse Town and fly the gummi ship to the next world. Traveling 
through space, they come upon a strange gray object ahead)

Donald: What is that?

Sora: Wow, it’s huge!

(It flies over them)

Goofy: It’s a giant whale!

Jiminy: It’s Monstro! He’s a whale of a whale, and vicious besides!

(It flies back around)

Donald: Whoa! Sora, get us out of here!

(It makes its way toward them, opening its enormous jaw, revealing a 
mouth full of teeth)

Sora: Too late! He’s going to swallow us!

(It overtakes the ship and Sora’s life flashes before his eyes. He 
remembers a day, 9 years ago, that he spent with Riku on the Destiny 
Islands. He walks down the stairs with Riku, his small hands folded 
behind his back)

Sora: It’s true! I saw it with my own eyes!

Riku: You sure you didn’t just hear it this time?

Sora: What difference does it make? There’s a huge monster in there, I 
tell you!

Riku: All right. Suppose there really is a monster... Think we can beat 
it by ourselves, Sora?

Sora: No problem. Let’s do it!

(They walk to the entrance of the Secret Place)

Sora: Listen! There! Can you hear it growling?

Riku: Shh, quiet.

(Riku bends closer, listening over the sounds of the waterfall nearby)

Riku: We’ve gotta be careful.

(They enter slowly and the sounds of the waterfall drift away. They find 
nothing in the empty cave apart from a hole in the ceiling that air was 
pushing through)

Riku: See that? It was just the wind making that noise.

Sora: Aw, man. I wish it was a monster! Hold on! What’s that over there?

(He looks over to see a wooden part of the cave wall. Riku inspects it 
closely)

Riku: A window, or maybe a door? It won’t open.

Sora (looking around at the empty walls): Geez, is that really all that’s 
in here?

Riku: What do you expect in a boring place like this?

(Sora continues searching the cave)

Riku: Hey, Sora.

Sora (looking back at him): Hm?

Riku: When we grow up, let’s get off this island. We’ll go on real 
adventures, not this kid stuff!

(Riku’s eyes grow wide with anticipation)

Sora: Sure. But isn’t there anything fun to do now? Hey, you know the 
new girl at the mayor’s house? Did you hear?

(Sora exits the cave, with Riku following, and the scene turns back to 
the present, the sounds of the wind becoming the sounds from Monstro 
the whale, where Sora, Donald, and Goofy have been thrown from the ship 
inside its mouth. Sora lies on the ground, hearing a yell)

Donald: Knock it off!

(Sora shakes his head and stands up to meet Donald and Goofy. Goofy is 
covering his head with his shield again while Donald taps his foot on 
the damp floor)

Goofy: Hey, Sora. Are you okay?

Sora: What are you guys doing? Where are we, anyway?

(He looks around before an item comes flying from overhead. Sora dodges 
backward)

Sora: Whoa!

Goofy: Uh, ya know, I think that big ol’ whale Monstro just swallowed us. 
And for today’s weather: expect showers.

(Another item falls and hits Goofy’s shield)

Goofy: Heavy showers!

(Donald continues to look up at someone on a high ledge, searching through 
a treasure chest)

Donald: Hey! Who’s there?

(A wooden puppet looks down at them from the ledge)

Pinocchio: It’s me.

Donald: Oh, it’s just Pinocchio. ...Pinocchio!?

(Jiminy jumps onto Sora’s shoulder)

Jiminy: Pinocchio?

(Pinocchio begins walking down the ledge away from them carrying a large 
gummi block)

Jiminy: Pinocch, where are you going? Pinocch! Come on, everybody! After 
him! Quick!

(Pinocchio hops along the various wood piles scattered throughout Monstro’s 
enormous mouth. Sora, Donald, and Goofy makes their way over to a wooden 
boat where Pinocchio is talking to an old man)

????????: What have you got there, Pinocchio?

(Pinocchio sets the green block down on the deck)

Pinocchio: With this, we can get out of her, Father.

????????: Really? With this big block? You think so?

Sora: It’s true.

(They turn to see Sora, Donald, and Goofy climbing the edge of the ship)

Sora: So, how did you end up here, Pinocchio?

(They stand onto the deck)

????????: Oh, my. So the whale swallowed all of you, too? My goodness.

Sora: Yeah, looks like it.

????????: My name is Geppetto. I’m Pinocchio’s father. When we got separated, 
I traveled all over, looking for him.

(Pinocchio is distracted by something behind him and he walks over the plank)

Geppetto: Thank goodness we’re together again.

(The puppet sees someone running further into the whale as Geppetto picks 
up the gummi block)

Geppetto: So, you seem to know Pinocchio quite well. I hope he was a good 
boy in my absence.

(He places the block near his bed as a goldfish swims in its bowl on the 
bedside table)

Geppetto: Well, we’ve all had quite a journey. Right, Pinocchio?

(He looks around for his son)

Geppetto: Pinocchio? I warned him not to wander off here. He can be a 
naughty boy. Even so, he’s very precious to me.

(Sora, Donald and Goofy go after Pinocchio, finding him hiding in an inner 
chamber)

Sora: What are you doing? Come on, let’s go back.

Goofy: You know, Geppetto’s awfully worried about you.

Sora (sternly): Pinocchio, stop fooling around! This is no time for games!

(They start to turn away)

Riku: But, Sora, I thought you liked games.

(Sora whirls around to see Riku)

Riku: Or are you too cool to play them now that you have the Keyblade?

Sora: Riku! Wh-What are you doing here?

Riku: Just playing with Pinocchio.

Sora: You know what I mean! What about Kairi? Did you find her?

Riku: Maybe. Catch us and maybe I’ll tell you what I know.

Sora: Come on!

(Riku grabs Pinocchio’s hand and leads him further into Monstro. They 
search through the various maze-like innards of the whale, fighting </pre><pre id="faqspan-4">numerous Heartless, though finding no trace of Riku or the puppet. 
Maleficent appears to Riku)

Maleficent: Why do you still care about that boy? He has all but deserted 
you for the Keyblade and his new companions, after all.

Riku: I don’t care about him. I was just messing with him a little.

Maleficent: Oh, really? Of course you were.

(She smiles)

Maleficent: Beware the darkness in your heart. The Heartless prey upon it.

(She summons a corridor of darkness and walks into it)

Riku: Mind your own business.

(He stares at her as she leaves. Sora, Donald, and Goofy chase Pinocchio, 
who passes by Riku into the bowels of the beast)

Sora: Riku! What’s the matter with you? What are you thinking? Don’t you 
realize what you’re doing?

Riku: I was about to ask you the same thing, Sora. You only seem 
interested in running around and showing off that Keyblade these days. 
Do you even want to save Kairi?

Sora: I do.

(Pinocchio screams and they run into the Bowels. They find him trapped 
inside a large Parasite Cage Heartless. It swings its appendages when 
they enter, waiting for them to come near)

Riku: You up for this?

(Sora assumes a fighting stance)

Sora: No problem. Let’s do it!

Pinocchio: Get me out of here!

(Sora attacks the small head attached to its arms as it swings the arms 
wildly. Riku runs behind it to avoid them and strikes. Sora leaps at it, 
while Donald sends a Thunder spell, but it lifts an arm and Sora crashes 
into it, falling to the damp floor)

Pinocchio: Help! It’s scary in here!

(Sora attacks the bottom cage-like head of the Heartless where Pinocchio 
is trapped, but the beast will not budge. Its arms take out Goofy while 
Sora gives it an upward strike. It begins to wobble, grabbing the ceiling 
for balance, and spits out Pinocchio into a hole in the floor. Riku jumps 
in after him as the Heartless escapes. The water level in the mouth 
decreases as Sora, Donald, and Goofy land on the deck of Geppetto’s ship)

Geppetto: Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Please! Give me back my son!

(Riku is on a high ledge, holding Pinocchio under his arm)

Riku: Sorry, old man. I have some unfinished business with this puppet.

Geppetto: He’s no puppet! Pinocchio is my little boy!

Riku: He is unusual. Not many puppets have hearts. I’m not sure, but maybe 
he can help someone who’s lost theirs.

Sora: Wait a minute. Are you talking about Kairi?

Riku: What do you care about her?

(He walks toward Monstro’s throat. They go after him by climbing the piles 
of wood near the mouth. Sora finds another summon gem on top of one of them. 
They enter the throat and make their way to the stomach. Riku sets Pinocchio 
down on one of the platforms lining the walls as stomach acid pools on the 
floor)

Sora: Hey, let Pinocchio go, Riku.

(He turns to see them. Pinocchio sits, unmoving)

Riku: A puppet that’s lost its heart to the Heartless... Maybe it holds the 
key to helping Kairi. How about it, Sora? Let’s join forces to save her. We 
can do it, together.

(He starts walking toward Sora, who takes out the Keyblade)

Riku (stopping): What? You’d rather fight me? Over a puppet that has no 
heart?

Sora: Heart or no heart, at least he still has a conscience.

Riku: Conscience?

(Jiminy Cricket runs over to Pinocchio)

Sora: You might not hear it, but right now it’s loud and clear. And it’s 
telling me you’re on the wrong side!

Riku: Then you leave me no choice.

Jiminy: Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

Pinocchio (weakly): Jiminy... I’m not gonna make it.

(Suddenly, his nose grows)

Pinocchio: Oh! I guess I’m okay!

(Jiminy jumps happily. Sora looks over to Donald and Goofy. Riku thinks 
for a second before looking up suddenly as the Parasite Cage falls from 
a hole in the ceiling. Riku makes a quick exit through a corridor of 
darkness, leaving them alone with the Heartless. Pinocchio runs out of 
the stomach and the Parasite Cage picks itself up on its arms and swings 
itself at Sora and company. Donald yells and sends a Thunder spell at it, 
while Sora runs up to it and begins striking its body with the Keyblade. 
The Parasite Cage begins swinging its arms again, but Goofy slams his 
shield into them, causing the Heartless to reel back. The top head falls 
backwards, causing the cage to open. It lies there, unconscious, while 
Sora continues to deal damage to it. It straightens up and begins swinging 
its arms again, knocking out Donald. The Heartless places its arms into 
the stomach acid, sucking it up through its appendages, and blowing it 
out through its mouth. Sora falls in pain Goofy falls unconscious. While 
the Parasite Cage continues swinging its arms madly, Sora uses Cure on 
both Donald and Goofy and the three of them move in unison. With a few 
more strikes, it flies backwards, a glowing heart coming out of its cage-
like mouth and floating away. It begins to fall over, splashing acid 
everywhere)

Donald: Run!

Sora: Riku! Riku, where are you?

(Riku has returned to his vessel, standing in the captain’s hold, talking 
to Maleficent)

Riku: So, Kairi’s like a lifeless puppet now?

Maleficent: Precisely.

(He stares at Kairi’s body, lying on the couch in front of him)

Riku: And her heart was...

Maleficent: Taken by the Heartless, no doubt.

(He whirls around, the desperation showing in his eyes)

Riku: Tell me! What can I do?

Maleficent: There are seven maidens of the purest heart. We call them the 
princesses of heart. Gather them together, and a door will open to the 
heart of all worlds. Within lies untold wisdom. There, you will surely 
find a way to recover Kairi’s heart. Now, I’ll grant you a marvelous gift.

(She leans closer to him)

Maleficent: The power to control the Heartless.

(She raises her arms and green energy surrounds him. He takes it in, 
feeling its power, and turns to look at Kairi)

Riku: Soon, Kairi. Soon.

(Monstro, disrupted by all this agitation, sneezes everyone out. Sora, 
Donald, and Goofy are back in their gummi ship)

Goofy: I sure hope Pinocchio and Geppetto are okay.

Donald: Yeah, hopefully they landed safely somewhere.

Sora: Riku...

(They return to Merlin’s Study in Traverse Town and speak to the Fairy 
Godmother)

Fairy Godmother: Oh, another summon gem? Let’s help this little one. Here 
we go! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

(Sora is granted the power to summon Dumbo)

Fairy Godmother: If you find any more of these stones, bring them to me.

(Sora enters the 100 Acre Wood, finding a broad expanse of vegetables 
fields. He walks across the bridge over the stream to a mailbox labeled 
“RABBiT”. There is a letter inside)

“I hope we’ll be finding more honey together soon!
--Pooh”

(Sora walks up to the door in the tree, but is stopped by a stern voice)

??????: Nobody’s home! And I’m out of honey!

(Sora walks to the back of the tree, where Piglet and Pooh are staring 
in through a hole in a burrow beneath a sign reading “RABBiT’S HOWSE”. 
Piglet sees Sora)

Piglet: Look, Rabbt’s house c-came back! But it looks like Rabbit isn’t 
home. Pooh’s been calling and calling, but the house says no one’s there.

Pooh (calling): Nobody’s home?

??????: That’s right, Nobody!

(Sora runs back around the house and enters through the door)

Pooh: Who is this person named Nobody?

(Pooh begins climbing into the burrow)

Pooh: Nobody, have you seen Rabbit?

??????: No! No Rabbit here! There’s no one here!

(Inside the burrow, a yellow rabbit sighs as Pooh hops in, Piglet following)

Pooh: Hello, Rabbit!

Rabbit: Why, P-Pooh. What a pleasant surprise... Nice to see you, too, 
Piglet. And...

(He turns around as Sora enters)

Rabbit: Is this a new friend? P-Pooh, I’m sorry, but... I’m all out of 
honey at the moment.

(Pooh walks around the room, sniffing the air)

Pooh: Sora, do you smell honey?

(Sora sees a honey pot on a tree root going through the ceiling)

Rabbit: H-Honey? Now, how did that get up there? Would you like some 
Pooh? Don’t feel you have to, of course.

Pooh: Oh, thank you, Rabbit. I would like just a small smackeral. I’m 
quite hungry.

(Pooh sits at the table eating from the honey pot)

Rabbit: Um, Pooh Bear...

(Pooh eats)

Rabbit: You’re not eating the whole pot, are you?

(And eats)

Rabbit: Once you start, there’s no stopping you, is there...

(And eats)

Rabbit (defeated): Ohh... Out of honey again.

(Sora leaves the house and attempts to walk off the grounds)

Piglet: H-Help! Please help Pooh!

(He turns around as Piglet runs up to him, and trips on the ground. Sora 
runs back inside with Piglet, seeing Pooh stuck in the hole in the wall)

Pooh: Oh, help and bother. I’m stuck again. I came in through this hole, 
so it must have shrunk.

Piglet: Oh, wh-what to do?

Rabbit: All this because he can’t stop liking honey so much! 

(Sora runs around to the back of the burrow, where Pooh’s head and arms 
are sticking out)

Pooh: Oh, how will I eat honey if I’m stuck here? When it’s lunch time, 
perhaps you could bring me a honey jar.

Rabbit: No honey ‘til you’re unstuck!

(Rabbit runs in)

Rabbit: If Pooh doesn’t slim down, my house will stay plugged up forever! 
If only there were something we could do...

(He perks his head up, his ears pointed)

Rabbit: Wait, I know! A bit of carrot top juice will do the trick! I have 
a carrot patch on the other side of the stream. Carrot top juice is just 
the ticket to slimming down a Pooh!

(He turns toward his garden and shouts)

Rabbit: Oh, no!

(He runs ahead, Sora following. He sees a stuffed tiger bouncing into the 
area much to Rabbit’s dismay. The tiger jumps onto the bridge, destroying 
it, and bouncing over to Sora. Rabbit runs over to see the damage and 
lowers his ears. The tiger tackles Sora, knocking him over, laughing as 
his tail uncurls behind him)

??????: Hey, there! Name’s Tigger! T-I-double-guh-RR. That spells Tigger!

(Tigger looks over Sora, standing on him)

Tigger: Well, now! I don’t think I’ve ever seen you before!

Pooh: Hello, Tigger. You’ve just bounced my new friend Sora.

Tigger: Hey, Pooh! Say, you’re lookin’ mighty uncomfy today. Is that some 
new exercise? Why, bouncin’ around is a lot more fun.

(He leaps off of Sora, who stands up, brushing the dirt off his clothes)

Sora: Wh-Why do you bounce around so much, Tigger?

Tigger: Why? ‘Cause bouncin’ is what Tiggers do best!

(He puts a paw to his forehead and looks around)

Tigger: Speaking of which, my bouncin’ spot has gone and disappeared! So 
for now, this’ll be my new bouncin’ ground.

(He laughs and bounces away towards Rabbit’s garden)

Rabbit: Tigger’s bouncing will ruin my vegetables! And if we don’t give 
Pooh some carrot top juice, he’ll be stuck forever.

(Rabbit turns to Sora)

Rabbit: Please help me! Keep Tigger away from my carrots!

Owl: This is quite a fix. But I have just the solution. Pay attention, now.

(Owl flies down to meet them. He takes Sora over to the carrot field)

Owl: Sora, you’ll have to protect this carrot patch. If Tigger bounces on 
a carrot twice, it’ll be buried.

(He demonstrates jumping on a carrot)

Owl: Once...

(He jumps again)

Owl: Twice!

(He flies back off the carrot)

Owl: Just like that. Protect the carrots from Tigger’s bounces and you’ll 
receive points. How you ask? It’s elementary!

(He swings out a wing)

Owl: Simply get to the carrots before Tigger lands on them. There are 
fifteen carrots here. Your score depends on how many you save, and how 
many times you block Tigger. Oh, and one more thing.

(He flies over to Sora)

Owl: The Rush command is the key to a high score. Select Rush while near 
a carrot that isn’t buried yet. You’ll dash to the target area before 
Tigger lands. Well, good luck!

(Tigger bounces over and Sora protects the carrots from him. Tigger dances 
around)

Tigger: How about those bounceroonies? They were good even for a Tigger.

(He laughs and bounces away)

Rabbit: Thank you so much. Now I’d better make that carrot top juice. I’ll 
get the carrots, so please wait inside the house.

(Sora enters the house. Later, Rabbit returns)

Rabbit: Oh, what a day! I gave Pooh the carrot top juice. All we have 
to do now is push him out. Just a little push should do.

(Sora runs and tackles Pooh out of the wall, sending him flying into a 
pile of honey pots. Piglet covers his eyes while Rabbit is in shock)

Rabbit: First my vegetable patch and now this...

(Pooh sits up, a honey pot stuck over his head)

Pooh: Oh, bother. Where am I? It’s ever so dark in here. Well, it isn’t 
so bad, I suppose. There is plenty of honey.

(He laughs and Sora regroups with Donald and Goofy in Merlin’s Study. They 
leave Traverse Town and compete in the Pegasus Cup at the Olympus Coliseum. 
After making their way through the tournament, they speak to Phil and 
Hercules)

Hercules: That was great! Looks like Phil’s trained another great hero!

Sora: Is strength the most important part of a hero?

Philoctetes: Well, what you really need is a strong heart. What makes a 
strong heart? If you have to ask, you’re not a hero yet!

Sora: Stop talking in riddles!

Philoctetes: It’s not a riddle!

(They travel to Atlantica)

Donald: Okay, guys. Prepare for landing.

Sora: Land where? In the sea? We’ll drown!

Donald: Not with my magic, we won’t. Just leave it to me.

(Under the water, fish scurry away as Sora, Donald, and Goofy appear in 
a flurry of bubbles. They inspect their new aquatic bodies. Sora has the 
tail of a dolphin, while Donald and Goofy are an octopus and a sea turtle, 
respectively. They swim around for a while, getting used to being 
underwater, before a mermaid and a small fish swim towards the alcove, 
followed by a red crab)

?????: Come on, Sebastian!

Sebastian: Ariel, wait! Slow down! Don’t leave me behind!

(Sebastian comes face to face with a glaring Donald and screams. He 
swims away frantically while Sora paddles up to them)

Ariel: Relax, Sebastian. They don’t look like one of them. Right, Flounder?

(She looks down to her fishy friend, who’s hiding behind her)

Flounder: I don’t know. There’s something weird about them.

(Sora laughs nervously)

Sora: What do you mean?

(She swims around him)

Ariel: They do seem... a little different. Where are you from?

Sora (nervous): We’re from kind of far away. And we’re not really used to 
these waters.

(Goofy has a staring contest with Flounder. Sora continues to laugh 
nervously, not sure of what to say)

Ariel: Oh, I see. In that case... Sebastian can show you how we swim 
around here.

Sebastian: Ariel, King Triton will not like this!

(Ariel rolls her eyes and smiles)

Ariel: Oh, don’t worry.

Sebstian: Easy for you to say... Okay, it’s time you learn how to swim 
properly. Practice swimming with Flounder. Try to tag him. All right. Begin.

(Sora plays tag with Flounder until he gets the hang of swimming)

Sebastian: Good job. Now let’s move onto self-defense.

Ariel: Sebastian!

(He looks over to Ariel, who is pointing to the Heartless swimming towards 
them from the tunnel. Sebastian starts swimming furiously as Ariel swims 
into a side cave)

Sebastian: Class is over. Good luck!

(Sebastian closes himself and Flounder in a clamshell. Sora, Donald, and 
Goofy fight off the Sea Neon Heartless. Ariel swims back when they’re gone, 
and Sora opens the clamshell)

Ariel: Those creatures chased us here.

Sebastian: Oh, no! Those monsters might be heading for the palace, too!

Ariel: We’d better head back right away!

Flounder: But, wh-what if we run into more on our way back?

(She looks over at the trio)

Ariel: I’m sorry, but we need your help. Please come to the palace with 
us. The trident markers on the walls point the way there. We won’t get lost 
as long as we follow them. Okay, let’s get going.

(They swim to King Triton’s Palace, pursued by Heartless. As they enter 
the Throne Room, a bolt of lightning obliterates the Heartless)

Triton: That was too close. As long as I have my trident, I will not 
tolerate those creatures inside this palace.

Ariel: Daddy!

(She swims up to him, smiling)

Triton: Oh, Ariel! When will you listen? It’s dangerous out there!

(She looks guilty)

Triton: Strange creatures lurk outside.

(He gazes at Sora, Donald, and Goofy with stern eyes)

Sebastian (clearing his throat): Behold. You swim before the ruler of 
the seas: His Majesty, King Triton.

Triton: And who are they?

Ariel: They helped us fight off those creatures.

Triton (warily): They don’t look familiar.

Sora: We’re from an ocean very far away.

Goofy (swimming around): Yup. We came to find the Keyhole.

Triton (stunned): The what?

Ariel: What’s that?

Goofy: A-hyuck! Well, it’s a—

Triton (angrily): There’s no such thing! Certainly not here!

Ariel: But, Daddy...

Triton: Ariel, not another word! You are not to leave the palace. Is that 
clear?

(She scowls at him and swims away. Sora, Donald and Goofy swim after her. 
Triton sighs)

Triton: Perhaps I’m being too strict... I’m just concerned for her safety.

(He watches them swim away)

Sebastian: Of course, Your Majesty. But I must admit, now I’m quite 
curious about this Keyhole.

Triton: That need not concern you, Sebastian. Have you anything to report?

Sebastian: Just as you suspected, Your Majesty, they seem to be coming 
from Ursula’s grotto.

Triton: I knew it. That sea witch is up to no good again.

(He strokes his long white beard)

Triton: I see exile from the palace has taught her nothing.

Sebastian: Yes, she poses serious danger.

Triton (sternly): And I told you to keep Ariel away from such danger, 
did I not?

Sebastian (nervously): Your Majesty, please, I, uh...

(Ariel leads Sora, Donald, and Goofy to the Undersea Valley)

Ariel: Come to my grotto. I want to show you something.

(She points to a large boulder on the sea floor)

Ariel: There it is. See?

(They enter Ariel’s Grotto, which is filled with various thingamabobs 
from the human world)

Ariel: Look at all the wonderful things Flounder and I’ve collected. I 
think it’s all from the outside world.

(At the end of the room, there is a trident-shaped impression in the rock)

Ariel: Someday, I’m going to see what’s out there. I want to see other 
worlds. Does that sound strange?

Sora: No. Not at all. I used to feel the same way.

Ariel: Used to?

Sora: I mean...I still do.

Ariel: Hey, why don’t we try looking for that Keyhole you were talking about?

Sora: But your father said—

Ariel: Oh, he treats me like a little girl. He never wants to let me do 
anything. He just... He just doesn’t understand.

(Sebastian listens from behind a rock, with a sad look on his face. They 
speak to Flounder)

Flounder: There’s this really big fish who can swim against the current. 
But he’s scared of those weird things swimming around. So if we chase 
them away, I think the big fish’ll play with us. Maybe if you grab onto 
him, he’ll take you somewhere.

(They swim out of the grotto, and two slippery eels come out of hiding. 
They each have a golden eye, glowing like their vicious grins. In her 
lair, the sea witch Ursula gazes into her cauldron at an image of Sora 
and Ariel, laughing to herself)

Ursula: Those impudent fools will never find the Keyhole.

(The image of Ariel floats out of the cauldron with Ursula’s hand movements)

Ursula: But the girl could prove useful. And I’ve got the Heartless on 
my side.

(Her long tentacles sway behind her)

Ursula: Triton, my old friend... Your day is coming.

(She cackles loudly. Meanwhile, Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Ariel find a 
dolphin swimming in the Calm Depths. After eliminating the Heartless in 
the area, the dolphin lets them ride it through the rough current to a 
large area with a Sunken Ship. They enter the ship and an ominous shape 
swims in the waters above. Once they reach a stateroom inside the sunken 
ship a huge shark crashes through the window, attempting to bite them. 
It is unable to swim inside the shape due to its size, so it swims away 
and waits for them to leave. Inside the ship they find a crystal trident 
inside a treasure chest)

Ariel: Hm. Its shape reminds me of something...

(They leave the ship, where Glut is waiting for them. After a persuasive 
battle, the shark gives up and swims away. They return to Ariel’s Grotto 
and place the crystal trident in the rocky impression)

Triton: Ariel, you’ve disobeyed me again!

(They turn to see King Triton enter. Sebastian is on the floor)

Triton: I told you not to leave the palace!

(He sees the crystal trident and is filled with anger. He raises his 
trident, which starts to glow. Ariel tries to stop him)

Ariel: Daddy, no!

(A bolt of lightning fires from the trident and destroys the crystal)

Ariel (sadly): How could you...

(She swims away from him and he turns his eyes on Sora)

Triton: Young man, you’re not from another ocean. You’re from another 
world. Aren’t you?

Sora (surprised): Huh?

Triton: Then you must be the key bearer.

Sora: How did you know?

Triton: You may fool Ariel, but you can’t fool me. You don’t know your 
dorsal fin from your tail.

Sora: Aw...

Triton: As the key bearer, you must already know... One must not meddle 
in the affairs of other worlds.

Sora: Of course I know that, but...

Triton: You have violated this principle. The key bearer shatters peace 
and brings ruin.

Goofy: Aw, Sora’s not like that.

Triton: I thank you for saving my daughter. But there is no room in my 
ocean for you or your key.

(Triton leaves the grotto, leaving Sora staring down at the Keyblade. 
Ariel is alone in the Undersea Garden, crying to herself, when the two 
devious eels arrive)

Flotsam: My, my, the poor child suffers such deep sorrow.

(They swim around her in circles)

Jetsam: What a pity. If only there were something we could do...

Flotsam: Wait. Maybe she can be of some help.

Jetsam: Yes. Maybe she can be of some help to you.

Ariel: Who’re you talking about?

(They start swimming upwards in a spiral)

Flotsam: Oh, she would surely help you.

Jetsam: She’d make all your dreams come true.

Flotsam &amp; Jetsam: Ursula can help...

(In a flourish of ink, Ursula appears)

Ursula: You called, my dear?

(She smiles down at Ariel)

Ariel (daunted): You’re Ursula? I was just wondering if—

Ursula: It’s all right. Helping others is what I live for. Let me guess. 
You wish to see other worlds. That shouldn’t be too hard. After all, 
your new friends came from another world.

Ariel: What?

(The witch swims closer to her)

Ursula: But they had special help—that mysterious key.

(Ariel looks toward the sea floor)

Ursula: Now, now. Cheer up, sweetie. You have something special, too.

(The eels swim around them as Ursula leans in closely)

Ursula: Now listen carefully. I think the Keyhole they seek is somewhere 
in the palace.

(Ariel swims into the palace throne room)

Ursula: Now, my dear, if you can take me there without your daddy knowing...

(Ariel turns as Ursula enters behind her)

Ursula: I can help you get to these other worlds you long for.

(She sees the trident floating behind the throne, and smiles. After Ursula 
snatches the trident, she laughs evilly)

Ursula: The trident is mine at last! And I couldn’t have done it without 
your help, my dear.

(Ariel is at the throne beside her father, who looks terribly weak)

Ariel: Ursula, no! I didn’t want this!

Ursula: Why not? Aren’t you tired of following your dear daddy’s orders?

(The eels swim around them)

Ursula: Oh, yes. We had a deal, didn’t we? Time for a little journey—to 
the dark world of the Heartless!

Flotsam: We cannot find the Keyhole.

Jetsam: The Keyhole is not here.

Ursula: What?

(She looks behind her as Sora, Donald, and Goofy swim their way)

Ursula: Why, we have company. I’m afraid you’re a little late, handsome!

(She chuckles, raising the trident and vanishing in a burst of ink just 
as they arrive. Ariel looks to King Triton)

Ariel: Daddy!

Triton (feebly): The trident... We must get it back.

Sora: Come on, let’s go!

(They start to swim out, but Ariel stops them)

Ariel: Wait, I’m going with you! My father is hurt and it’s all my fault. 
I have to stop Ursula!

(Sora nods)

Sebastian: That’s right. I’m right behind you, Ariel.

Triton: Ursula draws power from her cauldron. To defeat Ursula, you must 
strike her cauldron with magic.

(They return to the Sunken Ship area and find a large stone with the 
marking of a sea monster. Behind a sunken lifeboat nearby, there is an 
something embedded in the wall. Sora is unable to reach it)

Sora: What is that thing?

Sebastian: Need some help? I’ll show you how it’s done.

(Sebastian swims between the lifeboat and the wall and pushes the small 
rock in the wall, causing the large leviathan rock to sink into the 
ocean floor. They enter the Den of Tides and follow it to Ursula’s Lair. 
Ursula crawls out of her shell be, scowling)

Donald: Come out! You can’t run!

Sebastian: Your time has come!

(She swims toward them giving them a frightening look, scaring Sebastian 
and Donald. She tosses a potion into her cauldron, which starts to glow. 
Goofy and Ariel start fighting off Flotsam and Jetsam while Sora and 
Donald strike her cauldron with magic)

Ursula: Sea and wind, hear my command!

(Goofy and Ariel knock Flotsam and Jetsam unconscious and Sora sends a 
Thunder spell at Ursula’s cauldron, which ignites its contents, sending 
a burst of magic spilling out in all directions. Ursula is knocked out 
temporarily and Sora attacks with his Keyblade. Soon Ursula regains 
consciousness)

Ursula: Get up and fight!

(She heals Flotsam and Jetsam and begins cackling, spinning wildly in 
the water. Donald casts an Aero spell on everyone to shield them from 
her whirling tentacles. Sora starts striking her cauldron until it 
explodes again onto Ursula)

Ursula: No... Impossible!

(The foiled magic disintegrates Flotsam and Jetsam, to Ursula’s horror 
and she swims away in a fury)

Ursula: You’ll pay for this!

Ariel: Let’s go. We must get the trident back.

(She teaches them Mermaid Kick and they catch up to Ursula in the Open Ocean)

Ursula: You pathetic fools! I rule the seas now!

(She brandishes the trident and spins upwards. A wave of ink and 
darkness emanates from below as she begins growing to an immense size. 
A crown appears on her head and she towers over them)

Ursula: The sea and all its spoils bow to my power!

(They swim upward to escape from her crushing tentacles and she stares 
down at them with crazed eyes)

Ursula: Hey, you. Not so fast! Get ready for this!

(She spits out disorienting bubbles at them, which stop them for a 
second, but they swim straight at her and begin pummeling away. Suddenly, 
the current changes and Sora feels himself being swept upward towards her 
mouth. He swims away frantically as Ariel and Donald attack from behind. 
He manages to get away just as she bites down)

Ursula: Hmph... Slippery little morsel.

(Lightning strikes around them, a defense mechanism, as they attack her 
directly)

Ursula: You dare to strike me!

(She summons an energy beam which she aims at Sora, who begins swimming 
around her to dodge it, but she continues circling, unwilling to let 
him escape. She catches her breath after the intense beam leaves her 
defenseless. Donald and Ariel continue attacking her head while Goofy 
goes for her hand, which is still clutching the trident. She gathers 
strength again and lifts the trident high)

Ursula: This won’t be pretty!

(Several lightning bolts attack the water around them, almost knocking 
them all out. Ursula, at her wit’s end, begins inhaling water, dragging 
Sora toward her. Instead of swimming away, he uses this to propel 
himself toward her and tackles her with the Keyblade right into her 
throat. She tries to scream, holding her hands to her throat as the 
water around her crackles with energy. She begins flailing and 
disappears in a flurry of darkness, leaving only the trident floating 
in a beam of light. They return to the Throne Room and speak to King Triton)

Ariel: Daddy, I’m so sorry.

Sora: Please don’t be angry with her.

Triton: It’s my fault. You followed Ursula because... I wouldn’t let you 
follow your heart. And when you found that crystal, I lost my temper and 
destroyed it.

Goofy: Oh, yeah, the crystal! Why did you destroy it?

Triton: The crystal held the power to reveal the Keyhole. The Keyhole is 
dangerous. I had to keep you away from it at any cost.

Ariel: Daddy...

Triton: Key bearer, I have one more request: Seal the Keyhole. My trident 
also holds the power to reveal the Keyhole. Will you do it?

Sora: Of course. That’s what we had in mind from the start.

Ariel: Where is the Keyhole, Daddy?

Triton: You should know better than anyone. It’s in your grotto.

Goofy: Really... Sora, let’s go.

(They return to Ariel’s Grotto and Ariel uses the trident to reveal the 
Keyhole. Sora aims his Keyblade at it and seals it. Ariel floats over to him)

Ariel: Tell me, Sora. Your world, what’s it like?

Sora: Oh, about that... Sorry for lying to you.

Ariel (smiling): It’s okay. Besides, if you can travel to other worlds, 
maybe I can, too.

(She swims upwards in a spiral, looking towards the surface)

Ariel: So many places I want to see... I know I’ll get there someday. 
I’ll find a way somehow. I’m sure of it.

Sebastian (sighing): Well, if you find it, do me a favor and leave me 
out of it.

Ariel: This is from my collection. I want you to have it.

(She gives Sora a keychain and they return to the gummi ship)

Sora: I think my magic is as good as Donald’s now.

Donald: No way! Not in a million years.

Goofy: Why don’t you go see Merlin? Work more on your magic.

(They travel to Merlin’s Study and speak to him after training with him a bit)

Merlin: You’re making excellent progress. Here’s something for your effort.

(He gives them a keychain)

Merlin: Keep it up.

(Sora decides to return to the 100 Acre Wood with another torn page. 
He enters, finding a swing hanging from a stout tree near a river. He 
sees Pooh and Piglet on the bridge overlooking the river)

Piglet: Look, Pooh. Something is floating this way.

Pooh: I think you’re right, Piglet. What could it be?

(A gray donkey floats slowly along the current of the river, a glum 
expression on its face)

Pooh (waving): Why, it looks like Eeyore! Hello, Eeyore, if it is you.

(He floats toward the bridge)

Eeyore: Hello, Pooh. Yes, it’s me. Could you pull me out? That is, if 
it’s not too much trouble. Of course, you don’t have to if you don’t 
want to.

(He drifts under the bridge and Sora jumps in to get him. They meet on 
the riverbank with Pooh and Piglet)

Eeyore: Thank you, Pooh. Thank you, other you. You know, floating along 
out there, it seemed like something was missing...

(Piglet runs behind Eeyore)

Eeyore: And something’s still missing.

Piglet: Why, Eeyore’s tail is gone! Is that what’s missing?

(Eeyore looks behind him)

Eeyore: Let’s see... Yep, lost it again. Wonder where it went this time. 
It’s not much of a tail, though I’m sort of attached to it. But I don’t 
know why anybody’d look for it. Probably won’t find it anyway...

Pooh: Sora, why don’t we all look for Eeyore’s tail?

Owl: Lost something?

(Owl flies in from above)

Owl: Searching from a high place is the quickest way to find it!

Sora: Owl, can you fly up high and help us find Eeyore’s tail?

Owl: Sorry, but my eyes aren’t what they used to be. Too much reading, 
you know. But I can offer good advice! Of course, you don’t have to if 
you don’t want to. See that swing up there? Take Pooh there.

(He motions toward the tree at the top of a hill)

Owl: You’re a bit too big for the swing, but Pooh should fit nicely. I’ll 
tell you more when you get there.

(He flies away. Sora leads Pooh up the hill to the swing, where Owl is 
perched on the branch above them. Pooh gets on the swing)

Owl: Here’s what to do. First, get ready to push.

Sora: How?

Owl: Like this.

(Owl demonstrates)

Sora: Like this?

(Sora pushes the swing gently)

Sora: How’s this?

Owl: Not bad, not bad! Here’s the next step. If you time it right, Pooh 
will swing higher and higher. Try it! Push too soon, Pooh won’t go any 
higher. Push too late, he’ll go too high.

(With Owl’s help, Sora pushes Pooh on the swing, tossing him into the 
air so he can search for Eeyore’s tail from high above. He lands right 
in front of Rabbit on a house made of sticks, knocking Eeyore over. Pooh 
stands up and Eeyore sees something under the pile of sticks)

Eeyore: Hm? That looks familiar...

(Sora repins Eeyore’s tail onto him)

Pooh: How’s it looking?

Sora: There we go.

(Eeyore swings his tail around)

Eeyore: It’s not much of a tail, but it’s mine. Thanks, everyone.

Pooh: I wish we could put the Hundred Acre Wood back the way it was, too!

(Owl sits on the branch of the tree, waving a wing. Pooh’s words make 
Sora more determined to find the rest of the book’s torn pages. Sora 
leaves the hill and finds Pooh at his house, sitting on a log outside)

Pooh (shivering): Brrr! I think I spend too much time on the swing.

(Sora targets the pile of sticks in front of them and ignites them into 
a small fire. Pooh extends his hands to warm them)

Pooh: Thank you, Sora. This is nice and warm. You’ve helped us so much. 
This is just something to say thank you.

(Pooh hops off the log and gives Sora a Mythril stone. Sora leaves the 
100 Acre Wood and the three travel to a dark world filled with pumpkins 
and ghosts. Donald changes their outfits so they blend in with the eerie 
scenery)

Goofy: This sure is a spooky place. I’ll bet the people here are scary-
lookin’ too.

Donald: Don’t worry. We look spooky, too. If they scare us, we’ll scare 
them right back!

Goofy: You think so?

(They enter the Town Square and an explosion goes off in a nearby 
laboratory, sending smoke into the air. They see a group of Search Ghost 
Heartless in town, but they don’t attack. Sora makes his way over to the 
laboratory when they hear a booming voice)

?????: And now, allow me to introduce...

(They look over to see a short man in an extremely tall hat speaking 
through a megaphone. He wears a spider as a bow tie and a ribbon reading 
“Mayor” is attached to his business suit. From their angle, it looked 
like he had a second face behind his head)

Mayor: The master of terror... the king of nightmares—Jack Skellington!

(The line of Search Ghosts part as they present the fountain in the 
middle of the square, where a tall, thin figure was emerging from the 
green water. He had a black and white striped outfit and long bony 
fingers. His head was naught but a skull; behind his eyes, only 
blackness. He strikes a pose and smiles, and the Mayor runs over to him)

Mayor: Bravo, Jack! Bravo! Those ghosts will be a big hit at this year’s 
Halloween!

(The Mayor grins wildly as Jack steps out from the fountain)

Jack: Thank you, thank you! But their movement still needs work. It’s 
not scary enough.

(He hangs his head)

Jack: I want to strike bone-chilling terror.

(He lifts his arms in a creepy pose, and the Mayor backs up)

Jack: I’m going to consult the doctor.

(He stands and walks to the laboratory)

Mayor: Then I’ll go attend to the decorations.

(He runs away gleefully. So gleefully, in fact, that he runs in the 
wrong direction and has to turn around. Sora, Donald, and Goofy follow 
Jack to Doctor Finkelstein’s research lab, where the doctor is 
inspecting the Heartless on the examination table from the comfort 
of his wheelchair. The various machines on the walls gurgle and hiss)

Jack: I don’t understand. Maybe the guidance system was damaged in 
the explosion.

Finkelstein: Nonsense. My devices are always perfect!

(Jack searches through the doctor’s research book)

Jack: Oh, I’ve got it! Why, of course! The Heartless need a heart! 
Doctor, do you think we can add a heart to that device?

Finkelstein: Certainly. A heart’s not all that complicated.

(He rides his motorized wheelchair to the end of the table)

Finkelstein: Let’s get to work.

Jack (reading): To make a heart, first take a container with a lock...

(The doctor pulls out a pulsing box shaped like a human heart with 
a large keyhole on it)

Finkelstein: We need the key to this thing first!

Donald: You’re really gonna unlock it for them?

Sora: Why not? If they succeed, we won’t have to fight the Heartless, 
right? Besides, I want to see the Heartless dance, too. Don’t you?

Donald: Not really.

(Sora unlocks the heart for them)

Jack: My! That was amazing! Uh, and you are...

(He cocks his head to the side)

Sora: Sora.

(Jack walks up to him)

Jack: Well done, Sora! I’d like you to be a part of this year’s Halloween.

Sora (pointing): What’s this Heartless doing here?

Jack: Oh, the Heartless came to town just recently. What’s frustrating 
is I can’t get them to dance with me. So the doctor and I are trying 
to improve the guidance system. He’s quite a genius! Okay, Doctor, 
let’s continue. The ingredients for a heart: Pulse.

(A pulsing frog is placed on the table)

Jack: Emotion.

Finkelstein: Terror.

(Then a large spider)

Jack: Fear.

(The doctor’s hand slides off a pane of glass on the table, making 
an eerie screech)

Jack: Hope and despair.

(Two snakes, with their mouths over each other’s tails, are placed 
on the table and they glance at one another)

Jack: Mix them all together, and we have a heart!

(The doctor completes this and places the heart into the console of 
the machine. He wheels over to a large lever and initiates the 
experiment. The machine sparks to life, gears clicking and whirling. 
Electricity crackles over the Heartless, who suddenly sits up with 
its arms outstretched, before falling limp)

Finkelstein: It failed!

(Jack looks disappointed and the doctor peers over his research book)

Finkelstein: Maybe we’re missing some ingredients. Let’s try adding memory.

(The doctor opens his skullcap and literally scratches his brain)

Finkelstein (calling): Sally! Sally! Good-for-nothing girl! Don’t know 
why I bothered creating her!

(He slams his fists on the arms of his wheelchair and closes his skull. 
He whirls around to face them)

Finkelstein: Sally’s got the memory we need. See if you can track her down.

Jack (patting his chest): No problem. Sora, would you like to come along?

Sora: Sure.

(They leave the laboratory and see the Mayor at the bottom of the stairs, 
his unhappy face on)

Mayor (yelling into his megaphone): Jack! Jack! We have a major crisis! 
The Heartless are completely out of control! We can’t stop them!

Jack: Hmm... Maybe our experiment triggered something. Everything will be 
fine, Mayor. You have nothing to worry about.

(Donald taps his foot, looking in Jack’s direction. They enter Guillotine 
Plaza and fight a group of Heartless before entering the Graveyard)

Sora: Let’s check this place, too, once the Heartless here are out of our way.

(They defeat the Heartless in the Graveyard and a ghostly dog with a 
glowing pumpkin for a nose, rises out of his doghouse grave. Jack walks 
up to him)

Jack: Zero! Have you seen Sally anywhere?

(Zero flies over to a gravestone, startling the person behind it. A rag 
doll with long hair stands up and looks over at them, the stitches 
covering her body clearly visible)

Sally: Is something wrong, Jack?

Jack (excitedly): No, everything’s going great. We’re going to have the 
best Halloween ever. All we need now is your memory.

Sally: “Memory”? You mean this?

(She pulls out a gnarled flower. She gives the Forget-Me-Not to Jack, who 
stares at it curiously)

Sally: Jack, I have a bad feeling about this. Why don’t you try something 
else? There’s still time.

Jack: Nothing could beat what I’ve got planned!

(He spins around to face her)

Jack: Once we give the Heartless a heart, they’ll dance just as I 
envision it.

(Sally looks worried)

Jack: Trust me. You’re going to love it!

(Sora talks to Sally)

Sally: I have a bad feeling about this. If only Jack would reconsider... 
I’m happy if he’s happy, but I’m just so worried about him. I’m worried 
about him because I...well, I just am. Jack, why not have these kids star 
in the festival instead? They both look rather frightful. And funny, too. 
They’d be better than the Heartless.

(Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Jack leave the Graveyard, with Sally following. 
From a coffin near the end of the graveyard, laughter erupts before the 
lid flies open. Three little imps jump out dressed like a devil, witch, 
and skeleton, respectively. They wear masks on their faces because they 
like it)

Lock: Lock!

Shock: Shock!

Barrel: Barrel!

(They huddle together)

Barrel: Did you hear that?

Lock: Yeah, I sure did! A heart! What should we do?

Shock: Gosh, you really are stupid! Isn’t it obvious?

Barrel: Tell Oogie Boogie.

(They laugh. Sora and company return to Dr. Finkelstein’s Lab and give 
him the “memory”)

Finkelstein: Yes. This is it. Now, just one more ingredient. We need 
“surprise” to complete the heart. The mayor should know where it is.

(Meanwhile, Lock, Shock, and Barrel are trembling in the presence of a 
laughing monster named Oogie Boogie. He has the appearance of a burlap 
sack tied together with thread. Two holes for the eyes curve evilly, 
giving him a nightmarish look. His hands and feet end in points, rather 
than fingers, and an opening in the cloth is stitched together for the mouth)

Oogie Boogie: A heart? That bonehead Jack is really making a heart? I’ll 
be jiggered! That works for me!

(He smiles)

Oogie Boogie: Ohh, when I get my hands on that...

(He looks at his pointed extremities)

Oogie Boogie: Well, I’ve got no hands, but I’m still gonna nab that 
heart and control the Heartless.

(He cackles powerfully. Sora, Donald, Goofy and Jack find the Mayor in 
the Boneyard near a giant pumpkin and talk to him)

Mayor: Ghost rise from those tombstones. Check the tombstones in the 
order the ghosts appear. If you get it wrong, you’re in for a surprise!

(He points to a nearby group of gravestones, where they see three ghosts 
rising from various ones and vanishing. They pick the correct ones and 
there is an explosion behind them)

Mayor: Splendid! Now go look at the pumpkin.

(They turn around to see the pumpkin destroyed with a treasure chest 
inside. They open it and take out a Jack-in-the-Box. They return to Dr. 
Finkelstein’s Lab and give him the Jack-in-the-Box)

Finkelstein: Yes. This is it.

(The doctor assembles the ingredients into the heart)

Finkelstein: There you go. This time it’s sure to work.

(He wheels over with the heart on his lap, when Barrel jumps out from 
under his research table, tripping him over)

Barrel: Ya!

(Finkelstein yells as he falls out of his chair, causing the heart to 
bounce over the table and into Lock’s arms. The doctor growls, shaking 
a gloved fist at them.  Lock snickers and the three escape)

Finkelstein: The nerve of those little hooligans, stealing my work!

(Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Jack race after the trio to Guillotine Square)

Sora: We lost them!

(Jack taps a hand on his leg, calling Zero over to him)

Jack: Zero, after them, quick!

(Zero flies towards the Graveyard to Moonlight Hill, where a large 
curled hill unfurls, making a pathway to a bridge. Lock, Shock, and 
Barrel ride in a walking bathtub over the hill. Sora and company arrive 
and defeat the Heartless in the area. They find a hidden switch in a 
gravestone, which unfurls the hill for them and they walks across to 
the bridge to Oogie’s Manor, where the bathtub is approaching a wooden 
bridge. Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Jack run in)

Jack: I knew Oogie Boogie was behind this!

(They stare up towards the twisted mansion. They make their way up the 
mansion, fighting Heartless until they find the topmost room. They enter 
the Evil Playroom to find Lock, Shock, and Barrel tossing the heart down 
a shaft. They whirl around when they enter. Sora and company subdue the 
three imps and force them to talk)

Shock: We were just following orders! Oogie Boogie told us to steal the 
heart. It’s all Barrels fault! It was his idea to tell Oogie Boogie 
about the heart.

Lock: Yeah, that’s right!

Barrel: B-But you guys said—

Shock: You should be ashamed!

Lock: Oogie Boogie made us do it. We had no choice.

Barrel: Oogie Boogie told us not to give away his hiding place. Oh, and 
we’re not supposed to talk about the lever, either.

(Sora activates a lever on a control panel and gears in the wall begin 
to spin)

Barrel: What’s he going to do with the heart? Beats me. I’d stay away 
from Oogie Boogie if I were you.

Shock: Hey, I was just following Oogie Boogie’s orders! We don’t have 
the heart! Oogie Boogie has it!

Lock: There’s no way I’m gonna take you to him! If I did that, Oogie 
Boogie would eat us too.

Shock: You’ll never find the green door!

(They make their way down to Oogie’s Torture Chamber, which looks like 
a giant roulette wheel. They run in and find Oogie Boogie with the heart)

Jack: Oogie Boogie, give me back the heart!

Oogie Boogie: You want it? Well, then come on over and get it!

(He puts the heart in his mouth and swallows it to everyone’s surprise. 
He beings cackling)

Oogie Boogie: Now, let’s see if I can get their attention. (calling) Oh, 
Heartless!

(Two Gargoyle Heartless appear behind him)

Oogie Boogie: This is it?

(He starts to get angry)

Oogie Boogie (yelling): Nobody disrespects me! Nobody!

(He pulls a switch causing an explosion from behind Sora and company, 
knocking them into the pit of the roulette wheel. The Heartless fly down 
and attack them, but they are quickly defeated)

Oogie Boogie: C’mon, baby!

(Oogie, being a gambling man, throws exploding dice into the pit, but 
they dodge out of the way. Sora activates a switch that raises his 
section of the pit, allowing him access to the boogeyman. Sora holds a 
hand to his chest and raises his Keyblade, which lights up and a bubble 
drops down from above. The bubble pops, revealing a young elephant with 
enormous ears. Sora jumps onto Dumbo, grabbing onto the elephant’s hat. 
Dumbo flies into the air with his huge ears and sprays a torrent of water 
at Oogie Boogie. Once the boogeyman has had enough of this, he activates 
an explosion. Dumbo disappears and Sora is sent back into the pit. Donald 
attempts to strike Oogie from below with Thunder and Gravity spells)

Oogie Boogie: Buzzsaw!

(A spinning saw blade whirls past Sora, nearly slicing him in half. The 
roulette wheel begins spinning around, sending Sora, Donald, and Goofy 
in front of three slot machines)

Oogie Boogie: Bone Soldiers!

(The eys of the slot machines glow and they raise their pistols, shooting 
at the three of them. They jump out of the way onto another button that 
sends all four of them upward to face Oogie. They attack Oogie Boogie with 
everything they have, causing the villain’s burlap sack to open and a 
swarm of squirming bugs to fall all over the floor. Oogie Boogie screams 
before the sack falls motionless with the heart still inside as a final 
blue bug crawls out of it. It lands on its back, squirming on the floor 
of the pit)

Jack: So, that heart was a failure after all.

(They leave Oogie’s Manor, crossing the wooden bridge back to the ridge 
they entered from, when a large explosion occurs behind them, sending 
everyone off balance)

Jack: Huh?

(Dust billows out from the mansion and they hear Oogie Boogie moaning. 
When the dust settles, they see his body overtaking the house, covered 
in orb of darkness)

Sora: Whoa! How did he get so big?

Jack: Look! It’s brimming with the power of darkness! Oogie Boogie is 
drawing power from those dark globs!

Sora: So we just have to destroy those things, right?

(The four jump down as the bridge is now destroyed and make their way 
up the living mansion, destroying the dark orbs in their path. After 
the final one is taken out, the mansion quakes and crumbles to the 
ground. In its place a giant Keyhole appears. Sora sends a beam of 
light into the air, which breaks up and falls on the Keyhole, locking 
it. They return to Dr. Finkelstein’s Lab, where Sally is waiting for them)

Jack: Sally, why didn’t I listen to you?

Sally: Don’t feel bad, Jack. We’ll come up with another plan for 
Halloween. Next time, we’ll do it together.

(They hold hands and stare into each other’s eyes. Sora, Donald, and 
Goofy speak to Jack)

Jack: I guess we have no choice. We’ll have to cancel the Heartless 
Halloween festival for now. Here, I want you to have this.

(He gives Sora a keychain)

Jack: Visit us any time, Sora. Next year’s Halloween will be the 
scariest ever!

(The doctor is rereading his research book, thinking out loud)

Finkelstein: Emotion, memory... We put in all the necessary 
ingredients. What else do you need to make a heart? What is a heart, 
anyway? I can’t figure it out.

(They return to the gummi ship and fly through space)

Goofy: Uh, a big ship is catching up to us.

(The ship flies past them, its sails clearly visible)

Donald: Quit gawking! That’s a pirate ship!

(The Jolly Roger turns and heads straight for them)

Sora: It’s going to ram us! Hold tight!

(The gummi ship is taken aboard the Jolly Roger. Sora walks along 
the deck and turns around)

Riku: I didn’t think you’d come, Sora.

(Sora gasps, looking up at Riku on the main deck)

Riku: Good to see you again.

Sora: Where are Donald and Goofy?

Riku: Are they that important to you? More important than old 
friends? Instead of worrying about them, you should be asking...

(He moves over)

Riku: ...about her.

(Sora sees Kairi, sitting on the floor beside Riku. She is 
breathing, but making no reactions to anything around her)

Sora: Kairi!

Riku: That’s right. While you were off goofing around, I finally 
found her.
</pre><pre id="faqspan-5">(Sora starts to run towards them, when a hook blocks his path)

????: Not so fast. No shenanigans aboard my vessel, boy.

(Sora looks up to see the pirate captain smirking as he is surrounded 
by Pirate Heartless)

Sora: Riku, why are you siding with the Heartless?

Riku: The Heartless obey me now, Sora. Now I have nothing to fear.

(Sora glares at him and his careless eyes)

Sora: You’re stupid. Sooner or later they’ll swallow your heart.

Riku: Not a chance. My heart’s too strong.

Sora: Riku...

Riku: I’ve picked up a few other tricks as well. Like this, for instance.

(He raises a hand and Sora’s shadow lifts out of the ground. Sora stares 
at it in astonishment)

Riku: You can go see your friends now.

(A trapdoor opens underneath him and he falls through)

Riku (to the captain): Let’s get under way, already. And keep Sora away 
from Kairi until we’re ready to land.

(Riku walks towards the Captain’s Hold)

???? (to his First Mate): That scurvy brat thinks he can order me around!

????: What shall we do, Captain Hook?

Hook (frustrated): Nothing! The hold is crawling with Heartless.

(He makes flourished movements as he speaks)

Captain Hook: Let them keep an eye on the brats.

????: But, Captain, you-know-who is also down—

Captain Hook: Shh... Did you hear that, Smee? Oh, that dreadful sound!

(He looks around)

Smee: No, Captain.

Hook (shaking Smee): Are you quite sure? Did I imagine it? Oh, my poor 
nerves...

(Down in the Hold, Sora tells Donald and Goofy about Kairi)

Goofy: You don’t say?

Sora: Yeah, it was definitely Kairi. I’ve finally found her.

Goofy: All right! A-hyuck! Then let’s go up and talk to her.

Sora: Yeah!

Donald: Sounds great. Okay, but first...how about getting off!

(Sora and Goofy had fallen on top of Donald)

Sora: Oh, sorry.

(They get up off the floor and Sora peers through a window in the door)

?????: Ahem!

(Sora jumps down from the window and they stare at the barrels in the 
corner of the room)

?????: How ya doin’ there? Looking for a way out?

(Out jumps a young boy in green tights, carring a dagger in a scabbard 
at his waist. He wears a green cap over his fiery hair that has a red 
feather in it)

Goofy: Who are you?

????? (smiling): I’m the answer to your prayers.

(Donald taps his foot, giving off a squawk in disbelief)

?????: Okay, then. Fine. Have it your way.

Sora: But you’re stuck in here too, aren’t you?

????? (crossing his arms): No. I’m just waiting for someone.

Sora: Who?

(A bright light flies into the room and swirls around Sora, giving off 
magical dust. It flies up to the boy)

?????: Tinker Bell, what took you so long?

(The bright light fades and reveals a tiny pixie in a small leaf-like 
dress. Her wings flutter softly behind her blond updo as she speaks to 
him through light and sound)

?????: Great job. So you found Wendy?

(She continues making sounds that Sora cannot understand)

?????: Hold on. There was another girl there, too?

(Tinker Bell crosses her arms)

?????: Are you crazy? There’s no way I’m gonna leave Wendy there!

Donald: Aha. She must be pretty jealous.

(Donald laughs and Tinker Bell turns around, stamping her foot in the 
air and glaring at him. She flies over to him and kicks him on the beak, 
making him dizzy. She flies out of the room in a huff)

?????: Come on, Tink! Open up the door!

Sora: Ahem!

(Sora smirks, much to the boy’s chagrin)

?????: I’m Peter Pan.

(He holds out his hand)

Sora: I’m Sora.

(He moves his hand to shake, Peter’s but the boy pulls back)

Peter Pan: Okay, we’re in this together, but only ‘til we find Wendy.

(He puts his hands on his hips petulantly. They leave the room thanks 
to Sora’s Keyblade and are attacked by a swarm of Heartess. Sora’s 
Shadow appears in front of them, taunting them while floating in the 
air. Sora strikes it and they defeat the Heartless, making their way 
through the ship undetected. They walk through another hold as Peter 
Pan flies above them)

Goofy: So, uh, how come you can fly?

Peter Pan: Anyone can fly. You wanna try?

(He whistles and Tinker Bell flies into the room)

Peter Pan: Aw, haven’t you cooled off yet, Tink?

(He takes her by the wings and holds her over Sora, Donald, and Goofy, 
sprinkling magical dust on them)

Peter Pan: Just a little bit of pixie dust. There. Now you can fly.

(Donald jumps into the air, swinging his arms up and down, but he falls 
to the floor. Tinker Bell flies down and laughs at him, as he taps his 
finger on the floor. Meanwhile, Riku is in the Captain’s Hold talking 
to Captain Hook)

Captain Hook: What? So Wendy’s not one of the chosen ones?

Riku: There are seven, supposedly, and Maleficent says she’s not one of them.

(He faces the door)

Riku: Hoist anchor as soon as possible. Leave all the dead weight behind, 
including her.

Captain Hook: After the trouble of capturing her? And why those seven? 
What is Maleficent planning, anyway?

Riku: Who knows? As long as it means getting Kairi’s heart back, I 
couldn’t care less.

Captain Hook: You’re wasting your time! The Heartless has devoured that 
girl’s heart. I’ll stake me other hand it’s lost forever.

Riku: I will find it no matter what.

Smee: Uh, Captain...

(Captain Hook walks over to a speaking tube, where Smee’s voice was 
coming from)

Captain Hook: What?

Smee: The prisoners have escaped. What’s more, Peter Pan is with them.

Hook (annoyed): Blast that Peter Pan! All right, then! Bring the hostage 
to me cabin, Smee! Hop to it!

(In the Galley, Tinker Bell is flying up near the ceiling, getting Peter 
Pan’s attention)

Peter Pan: What is it, Tink?

(A young girl in a blue dress is sitting on her cot in the room above. 
There is a grate in the floor with which to see and hear through. She 
turns her head towards the sound)

?????: Peter? Peter Pan?

(She stands up cordially and rushes to the grate in the floor, kneeling)

Peter Pan: Wendy!

Wendy: Please hurry! The pirates are coming!

Peter Pan: What! I’ll be right up there! Just hold on!

Sora: Wendy?

(She looks over at him)

Wendy: Yes?

Sora: Is there another girl in there with you?

(She looks up at Kairi, who’s still sitting limp on the floor)

Wendy: Oh, why, yes. But she seems to be asleep. She hasn’t budged an inch.

Sora: Kairi? Kairi!

(Sora can see part of Kairi’s leg through the grate. Her arm falls next 
to her with the movement of the ship. He holds out a hand with a sad, 
but hopeful face. Wendy stands up and grabs hold of a dresser. Kairi’s 
fingers twitch, putting a smile on Sora’s face. The door opens and Kairi 
is dragged away. Wendy cries out as she is taken away and the door shuts)

Peter Pan: Wendy! Hey, let’s get up there!

(They reach a higher level of the ship in the hall where Wendy’s cabin is. 
Peter Pan bangs on the locked door)

Peter Pan (calling): Wendy, are you in there?

(They enter another door into a room with a ladder. They climb up to the 
Captain’s Hold. Sora runs ahead and sees Riku)

Sora: Riku, wait!

(Riku holds Kairi in his arms as a shadow flows in from under the door 
behind him. Riku backs away towards the door and the shadow leaps out 
of the floor. It looks just like Sora, staring eerily with glowing eyes. 
Riku escapes and the shadow crawls along the floor underfoot. Jumping up 
at Sora, striking him with a dark duplicate of the Keyblade. It moves 
like Sora, attacking and deflecting blows just the same. Sora goes after 
it, but it sinks back into the floor, splitting into three copies. The 
room crowded, Peter Pan flies forward striking them with his shadow and 
giving a loud crow. He destroys two of the shadows, leaving the real one 
at the mercy of his blade. Antisora vanishes into a burst of darkness 
and turns invisible. Catching Sora offguard, he swipes at him in the air, 
visible for only a second, before disappearing. Antisora makes no sound 
due to its status as a shadow, so they don’t have the help of following 
its footfalls. Donald attempts to bring it out with Thunder spells, but 
it wears him out and comes up empty. It strikes at Peter Pan, but Goofy’s 
shield blocks it. Sora uses Strike Raid, tossing his Keyblade through the 
room. It flies through the air, spinning wildly until it makes contact 
with Antisora, who freezes on the spot, it’s darkness dripping to the 
floor. It stands there motionless like a statue before falling into the 
dark pool. Sora’s shadow returns to him and they drop down through the 
floor into Wendy’s room. They find her laying on the floor with her eyes 
closed. Peter Pan floats down next to her and picks her head up)

Peter Pan: Wendy!

(Tinker Bell flies around in the air above him)

Peter Pan: Come on, Tink! Not now!

(He waves her off and she flies away)

Peter Pan: Well, this is as far as I can go. I’ve gotta help Wendy.

(He picks her up and flies out of the room, leaving Sora, Donald, and 
Goofy by themselves. They return to the Captain’s Hold and takes the 
doorway to the Main Deck, where they find Captain Hook and his army of 
Heartless)

Captain Hook: Quite a codfish, that Riku—running off with that girl 
without even saying goodbye.

(He waves in the air)

Sora: Run off where? Tell me, where did he go?

(He swipes at the air with his Keyblade)

Captain Hook: To the ruins of Hollow Bastion, where Maleficent resides. 
But you won’t be going there.

(He takes an unlit lantern from Mr. Smee, holding it up. Tinker Bell 
is trapped inside with her hands on the glass. Sora gasps)

Captain Hook: Unless you intend to leave your little pixie friend behind?

(He holds his hook up to the lantern scraping the glass with it, scaring 
Tinker Bell. Sora sighs in exasperation, dispelling the Keyblade. The 
Pirate Heartless surround them, knives bared)

Captain Hook: Hand over the Keyblade and I’ll spare your lives. Be glad 
I’m merciful, unlike the Heartless. So, which will it be? The Keyblade, 
or the plank?

(He points his hook in the direction of the plank, a wooden board 
hoisted off the side of the deck. He hears a sound in the air and looks 
to see a sharp-toothed crocodile in the water, the clock inside its 
belly ticking away)

Captain Hook (terrified): It’s him! The crocodile that took me hand! 
Oh, Smee! He’s after me other hand! I can’t stay here!

(It stares up at him hungrily)

Captain Hook: Go away! Oh, I can’t stand the sight of him!

(Hook retreats to his cabin)

Captain Hook: Smee, you take care of them!

(The Pirate Heartless force Sora onto the plank, who backs slowly 
towards the ocean. When he reaches the edge of the plank, the 
crocodile opens its wide mouth and Sora hears Peter Pan’s voice)

Peter Pan: Fly, Sora! Just believe, and you can do it!

(Sora closes his eyes and leaps backwards off the plank. He descends 
toward the crocodile, who jumps at him, but at the last second flies 
into the air over the deck. Peter Pan swoops down and takes Tinker 
Bell from Smee, who is distracted by Sora. Sora and Peter Pan land on 
the deck in front of the flabbergasted first mate. Peter Pan opens the 
lantern, setting Tinker Bell free)

Sora: Thanks, Peter.

Peter Pan: Hey, don’t mention it. You didn’t think I’d leave you and 
Tink behind, did you?

(Tinker Bell floats down next to them and Smee runs away, leaving them 
to deal with the Heartless swarming the deck)

Sora: You’re all going down!

(They start attacking the Heartless on the ship and in the air. Sora 
holds a hand to his chest and the Keyblade flashes. He throws it into 
the air and catches it. Magic sparks burst out of the tip of the 
blade uncontrollably and he loses his grip on it. In a final burst 
of magic, it creates blue smoke which billows upward. Genie appears 
inside the smoke with a huge grin on his face. He yells and flexes 
his muscles, spinning around and giving Sora a high five. Genie targets 
the surrounding Heartless and shoots them with several magic spells)

Genie: Toodle-oo!

(He waves and disappears. Once the Heartless are taken care of, Sora 
and Peter Pan wait outside the Captain’s Hold. Peter knocks on the door 
with a devilish grin)

Captain Hook: Is that you, Smee? Did you finish them off?

(Peter laughs silently to himself and pinches his nose to sound like Smee)

Peter Pan (as Smee): Aye, Captain. They walked the plank, every last 
one of them.

(Captain Hook runs out past them and looks around, seeing nobody there, 
before Peter Pan pokes him with his dagger. Hook shout and jumps into 
the air, stumbling over his words)

Captain Hook: P-Peter Pa—blast you!

(He glares at the smiling boy)

Peter Pan: Ready to make a splash, you codfish? Now it’s your turn to 
talk the plank!

(He points toward Hook. Battleship Heartless appear in the air, raining 
down cannon fire on them. Donald and Goofy fly in the air after the 
Heartless while Sora and Peter Pan go after Hook, who slashes in the 
air frantically at them)

Captain Hook: Fire!

(Hook throws a box at Sora, which exploded in his face as Peter Pan 
charges at him with his dagger. Hook blocks and knocks Peter back)

Captain Hook (mockingly): Come and get me!

(Sora slides towards him and attempts to strike with the Keyblade, but 
Hook jumps back near the rudder. Sora flies up and after him. He sends 
a Fira spell at the Captain, which sets his trousers on fire, causing 
him to run around hysterically. He runs over the guardrail of the top 
deck, and Peter Pan knocks him into the water, making a big splash. He 
surfaces in front of the crocodile, who opens his mouth happily, his 
tongue lolling about as he pounces at Captain Hook. The captain runs on 
the water, screaming, as the crocodile chases him out of sight. Later, 
Sora stands at the guardrail away from Donald, Goofy, and Peter)

Goofy: Uh, Kairi couldn’t wake up, so maybe she’s really lost her—

(Goofy puts his hands over his chest)

Donald: Shh!

(Goofy makes a gulping sound)

Peter Pan: Sora.

Sora: I still can’t believe it.

(He looks into the night sky, smiling)

Sora: I really flew. Wait ‘til I tell Kairi. I wonder if she’ll believe 
me. Probably not.

Peter Pan: You can bring her to Never Land sometime. Then she can try 
it herself.

Sora: If you believe, you can do anything, right? I’ll find Kairi. I 
know I will. There’s so much I want to tell her—about flying, the 
pirates, and everything else that’s happened.

(Tinker Bell flies in and speaks to Peter)

Peter Pan: What’s that, Tink? What about the clock tower? You say 
there’s something there?

(They fly off the ship away from Never Land to a quaint city where the 
moon is shining brightly over the large clock tower. The tower has four 
faces, a clock on each side. As they approach, a cloaked Heartless flies 
alongside them. Sora looks over and it stares at him beneath its hood, 
darkness trailing in the air behind it. They stop and it faces them in 
front of the tower, gathering magic in its fingers. The numbers of the 
clock start to glow and the minute hand begins to move forward. Donald 
sees this and quickly casts stop on the clock. The Phantom Heartless 
swoops forward and attempts to claw at Sora with its sharp fingers. A 
bright orb of magical energy appears at the base of the Heartless’s 
cloak. Sora strikes it with his Keyblade and it turned red in color. 
Donald shoots a Fira spell at it and it turns blue. Smiling, Donald 
aims a Blizzara spell, and the orb disappears. The Phantom recoils, 
enraged. It spins around and releases a dark fireball. Sora tries to 
fly away but it strikes him in the back. Goofy tosses him a Potion and 
they continue their magic strategy until the Phantom begins to falter 
in the air. Its hands cover its stomach, bending over in front of the 
clock. From beneath its cloak, a heart floats out, and the Phantom 
falls and fades away. Wendy sits at the clock tower as they fly towards 
her. She stands up as they land. Soon, the clock strikes midnight and 
the Keyhole appears, shining bright enough to be seen from a distance, 
flashing between the 2 and 3 on the clock. Sora aims his Keyblade at it 
and locks it. It glows and disappears, releasing a gummi block. Meanwhile 
in Hollow Bastion, Riku’s memories flash through his mind. He recalls 
the day nearly 9 years ago when he and Sora discovered the Secret Place)

Riku: Hey, Sora.

Sora (looking back at him): Hm?

Riku: When we grow up, let’s get off this island. We’ll go on real 
adventures, not this kid stuff!

(Riku’s eyes grow wide with anticipation)

Sora: Sure. But isn’t there anything fun to do now? Hey, you know the 
new girl at the mayor’s house? She arrived on the night of the meteor shower!

(Sora exits the cave, and Riku follows him, before stopping to look back 
at the wooden door. A golden Keyhole has appeared on the door and he stares 
at it in fascination. Riku snaps back into reality, a light from the 
ceiling casting its glow on him. He is kneeling on the floor, entirely 
out of breath. He breathes heavily as green torches burn on the walls. 
Maleficent stands over him, holding her staff strongly, looking down on 
him with dominating eyes)

Maleficent (deriding): It was reckless to bring her here without at 
least using a vessel. Remember, relying too heavily on the dark powers 
could cost you your heart.

(A booming roar resounds from outside the castle, causing Riku to 
stand and look toward the source of the noise. Maleficent smiles)

Maleficent: A castaway.

(Riku narrows his eyes)

Maleficent: Though his world perished, his heart did not. When we took 
the princess from his castle, he apparently followed her here through 
sheer force of will. But fear not. No harm will come to you. He is no 
match for your power.

Riku: My power?

Maleficent: Yes, the untapped power that lies within you. Now, child, 
it’s time you awakened that power and realized your true potential.

(A green aura surrounds Riku and he feels stronger. Meanwhile, Wendy 
walks along the clock tower as Peter floats near her)

Wendy: Peter, are you really going back to Never Land?

Peter Pan: Afraid so. But we can see each other any time. As long as 
you don’t forget about Never Land, that is.

(He floats closer and they hold hands. Tinker Bell sees this and 
crosses her arms in jealousy. Donald laughs at her until she turns 
around and glares at him. He clamps his beak shut and the pixie 
flies over to Peter and Wendy, spinning angry circles around them. 
Then she does the same to Sora)

Peter Pan: Oh, boy. She’s getting’ steamed again. Do me a favor. 
Look after her for me, will ya?

(Tink floats up to Sora and spins around)

Sora: What?

(Sora talks to Wendy)

Wendy: Peter remains with me as long as I remember him. You will 
find Kairi if she remains in your heart. You’ll find her Sora. 
Just don’t give up.

(Sora, Donald, and Goofy board the gummi ship)

Donald: Well, we found the Navi-Gummi piece. Let’s go back to town.

Sora: Cid’ll install it on the ship once we bring it to him.

(They return to Traverse Town and travel to the First District, 
where they find Pinocchio and Geppetto in a new house)

Sora: Pinocchio?

Pinocchio: Hey, it’s Sora!

Geppetto: Well, hello, Sora!

Sora: How did you get here?

Geppetto: A man named Leon helped us. He even got us this house 
to live in. I don’t know how I’ll ever repay his kindness. Say, I 
hear you three are fighting the Heartless. I thought I might be 
able to help you, so I made this.

(He gives them a gummi ship blueprint)

Sora: For us?

Geppetto: But of course! Pinocchio and I can’t thank you enough! 
We’ll do anything we can to help you.

Pinocchio: I’m being good, even without Jiminy’s help.

(They leave and speak to Cid in the First District)

Cid: Looks like you found the other one. Let me see it.

(They hand him the gummi block)

Cid: Okay, wait here. I’ll get it installed right now.

(As they wait for Cid to modify their ship, Sora stares at the ground sadly)

Donald: Sora!

Goofy: Now, just remember what Donald said to ya: no frowning, no sad faces.

Sora: How can you be so cheerful? There’s still no sign of your king. 
Aren’t you worried?

Donald: Aw, phooey.

Goofy: The king told us to go out and find the key bearer, and we 
found you. So as long as we stick together, it’ll all work out okay. 
Ya just gotta believe in yourself, that’s all.

Sora: Just believe...

(Sora closes his eyes and hears a voice)

Kairi: I believe in you.

(Sora finds himself flying toward a great shining light, which envelops 
everything. Slowly, a room began to fade in around him, filled with 
bookshelves and stained glass windows. He floats in the air, watching)

Sora: Where am I?

(He sees an old woman sitting on a chair under a long staircase. A young 
girl with red hair runs up to the woman, who smiles down at her)

Grandmother: Long ago, people lived in peace, bathed in the warmth of 
light. Everyone loved the light. Then people began to fight over it. They 
wanted to keep it for themselves. And darkness was born in their hearts. 
The darkness spread, swallowing the light and many people’s hearts. It 
covered everything, and the world disappeared. But small fragments of 
light survived...in the hearts of children. With these fragments of 
light, children rebuilt the lost world. It’s the world we live in now. 
But the true light sleeps, deep within the darkness. That’s why the 
worlds are still scattered, divided from each other. But someday, a 
door to the innermost darkness will open. And the true light will return. 
So, listen, child. Even in the deepest darkness, there will always be 
a light to guide you. Believe in the light, and the darkness will never 
defeat you. Your heart will shine with its power and push the darkness 
away. Do you understand, Kairi?

(Sora blinks and the woman disappears)

Sora: Kairi!?

(He scans the room, seeing no one for a second. Blinking again, he is 
back floating in the air, seeing the 4 year-old Kairi, who looks around. 
He bends forward, trying to reach her, but she disappears and he is 
thrown back to reality)

Sora (shocked): Huh?

Goofy: What’s the matter?

Sora: Um, nothing. Kairi... Did you call me?

(Cid walks back to them)

Cid: I installed that navigation gummi. But, ya know? That place is 
crawling with Heartless. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

(Sora looks confused)

Cid: Here, take this along.

(He gives them a gummi block. They leave for the Olympus Coliseum and 
compete in the Hercules Cup. They reach the final match with Hercules)

Hercules: Show me what you’ve got!

Sora: Hercules, wait. Let’s go one-on-one!

Donald: Oh, brother. What a show-off.

Goofy: What’re we gonna do?

Donald: Let him go alone, I guess.

Goofy: Good luck, Sora!

Hercules: I’m not gonna go easy on you!

(Sora fights and defeats Hercules, winning a trophy. Phil dances on 
the steps of the arena as Sora smiles at Donald and Goofy, holding 
the trophy in his hands. They return to the Vestibule)

Hercules: Wow! And I didn’t even hold back!

Sora: Now I finally know what you mean about strength of heart. Mine 
comes from Donald and Goofy.

Philoctetes: Come again?

Sora: If we stick together, we’re unbeatable. Not even Hercules 
stands a chance.

(Hercules smiles)

Sora: With these guys beside me, I’m ready for anything!

Philoctetes: But that’s not exactly what I—

Hercules (picking Phil up): Of course. Your friends give you 
strength. Isn’t that right, Phil? The three of you together make 
great heroes.

(He puts Phil back down)

Hercules: And as a team, I’m sure you can overcome anything.

(Sora and Hercules slam their hands together. Sora, Donald, and 
Goofy push the pedestal in the room over to reveal the Keyhole in 
the floor. Sora stands in front of it and holds his Keyblade up. The 
blade glows and the Keyhole is sealed. Sora talks to Hercules)

Hercules: Phil wasn’t happy that I lost to you. Said I was getting 
soft. You beat me last time, but next time won’t be so easy.

(They leave the Olympus Coliseum and travel to the next world. They 
disembark on a tiled platform in the middle of a raging waterfall. 
Strangely, the waterfalls seem to be going upward. Goofy points further 
ahead, past the waterfalls)

Goofy: Gawrsh, look at that!

Sora: I know this place...

(They walk closer and gaze up at Hollow Bastion, a ruined castle, 
twisted by the darkness inhabiting the world for so long)

Goofy: Hmm, that’s strange.

Sora: I wonder why... I feel this warmth inside, right here.

(He places his hand on his chest)

Donald: Aw, you’re just hungry.

Sora: Hey, I’m serious!

(A loud roar erupts from further ahead, startling them)

Sora: Let’s go!

(They travel along the crystalline platforms toward the origin of 
the sound. Above on a platform with a stone arch, Riku is confronting 
a figure in a violet cloak. From the hairy claws and tail protruding 
from the bottom of the cloak, it was undeniably animal)

Riku: No vessel, no help from the Heartless... So tell me, how’d you get here?

(The beast stands on its hind legs as a human, and it gazed upon Riku 
with the same resolution as human eyes would, but the rest of its body, 
from its horns to its fangs to its claws, screamed otherwise. It began 
to speak, its voice low and rough)

Beast: I simply believed. Nothing more to it. When our world fell into 
darkness, Belle was taken from me. I vowed I would find her again no 
matter what the cost. I believed I would find her. So, here I am. She 
must be here. I will have her back!

Riku (challenging): Take her, if you can!

(The beast roars and leaps up at Riku. It swipes at him with its sharp 
claws, but Riku flips backward, dodging the attack completely. The beast’s 
cloak settles to his side as Riku lands on his feet. With lightning 
speed, Riku charges forward at the beast. Sora arrives in time to see 
the beast fall to the ground with a stinging growl)

Sora: Stop!

(Riku looks over at the three of them standing in front of the beast. He 
smirks confidently)

Riku: So, you finally made it. About time. I’ve been waiting for you. 
We’ve always been rivals, haven’t we? You’ve always pushed me as I’ve 
always pushed you.

Sora: Riku...

Riku: But it all ends here. There can’t be two Keyblade masters.

Sora: What are you talking about?

Riku: Let the Keyblade choose...

(He holds a hand to his chest)

Riku: ...its true master.

(He extends his hand out toward the Keyblade, which begins to shake 
violently in Sora’s grasp. Sora grabs the blade with two hands as it 
starts to pull itself toward Riku. The Keyblade flashes out of Sora’s 
hands...)

Sora &amp; Goofy: Huh?

Donald: What!?

(...and reappears in Riku’s. He stares up at it, smiling darkly)

Riku: Maleficent was right. You don’t have what it takes to save Kairi.

(He turns his gaze skyward)

Riku: It’s up to me. Only the Keyblade master can open the secret door...

(He holds the blade high)

Riku: ...and change the world.

Sora: But that’s impossible. How did this happen? I’m the one who 
fought my way here with the Keyblade!

(Riku looks at his Keyblade again)

Riku: You were just the delivery boy.

(He dispels the blade and pulls out a wooden sword)

Riku: Sorry, your part’s over now. Here, go play hero with this.

(He tosses the sword to Sora, which lands on the stone platform with 
a clunk. Sora falls to his hands and knees in defeat as Riku leaves. 
Donald and Goofy watch him leave)

Donald: Goofy. Let’s go. We have to remember our mission.

Goofy: Oh! Well, I know the king told us to follow the key and all... But...

(He gazes back toward Sora giving a sad grumble. Donald stops)

Donald: Sora, Sorry.

(They continue after Riku. Sora doesn’t move, feeling the cold stone 
beneath his fingers and the spray of the water on his clothes. He is 
nearly deaf to the low growl and thumping footsteps behind him. He 
looks up, seeing the beast walk past him. He watches as it falls to 
the ground again with a moan. Sora gets up and runs to his side)

Sora: Hey, don’t move. You’re hurt.

(He looks over at Sora, who notices his intensely human eyes)

Beast: Why... Why did you...you come here? I came to fight for Belle.

(He looks up at the castle and stands up again. He starts slowly walking 
ahead)

Beast: And though I am on my own, I will fight. I won’t leave without 
her. That’s why I’m here.

(Sora turns around, staring at the wooden sword on the ground. He picks 
it up and walks back to the Beast’s side)

Sora: Me too. I’m not gonna give up now. I came here to find someone 
very important to me.

(They make their way up to the furthest platform and gaze at Hollow 
Bastion. Mysterious gases swirl from pipes protruding from the castle. 
The center of its towers displays a large Heartless emblem, shattered 
from the inside, the gears clearly visible from the platform. Mechanical 
cranes are built into all sides of the castle, though are largely rusted 
and overgrown, as if the innards of the castle themselves came alive and 
rooted themselves deeply across its façade. The rest of the world below 
has become a barren crystalline wasteland and darkness waits at every 
corner. A switch activates and a pink light appears at the castle. A 
magical line appears toward them, bringing a metal platform with it, 
rigged to the line with electric sparks. Sora and the Beast walk onto 
the elevator, which takes them up to Hollow Bastion. Finding the castle 
gates locked, they descend into the watery underbelly of the fortress, 
finding the access switch in the confusing maze of the dungeons. They 
release the switch, and the gears in the wall begin to spin and they 
hear the sound of a door opening. Heading back to the castle gates, 
they enter the main Hall. Meanwhile in the Grand Hall, Jasmine, Alice, 
and the other princesses of heart are encased in crystal chambers on 
the sides of the room under the effects of a sleeping curse. Maleficent 
walks over an ornate carpet bearing the Heartless insignia toward a 
large open room, each footfall echoing in the vacant hall. Kairi’s 
body rests in a dark capsule in the center of the room. Maleficent’s 
fingers curl around her staff as she passes the capsule and ascends 
the stairs. She whirls around to face the princesses of heart)

Maleficent: O purest of hearts! Reveal to me the Keyhole!

(She raises her arms fervently. The hearts of the six maidens lining 
the walls glow in unison and beams of pink light shine out from them. 
The six meet at a point in the air over Kairi’s body, pointing a trail 
of sparkles to a great heart in the room beyond. Maleficent watches, 
and smiles. Meanwhile, Sora and Beast arrive in the Entrance Hall, 
seeing no one)

Beast: Be on your guard. They’re close, I can feel it. Are you ready 
for them?

(Sora moves forward as Beast gasps)

Beast: Belle?

(He whirls around, seeing the faint shape of a woman in a golden dress 
in the dark doorway. It erupts into a cloud of darkness, where a Shadow 
Heartless appears. The Beast shakes, rage and frustration flowing 
within him. He gives out a great roar and charges after the Heartless, 
the door closing in on him, separating him from Sora. The sound echoes 
in Sora’s ears)

Riku: Quit while you can.

(Sora turns, seeing Riku with Donald and Goofy)

Sora: No. Not without Kairi.

Riku: The darkness will destroy you.

(Tendrils of darkness erupt around Riku and his clothes take on a darker 
quality. He clenches his fists, feeling the dark powers inside his heart, 
and glares at who he used to call a friend)

Sora: You’re wrong, Riku. The darkness may destroy my body, but it can’t 
touch my heart.

(He holds a hand over his chest)

Sora: My heart will stay with my friends. It’ll never die!

Riku: Really... Well, we’ll just see about that!

(He thrusts his hand forward, releasing a dark fireball aimed straight 
at Sora’s heart. The energy courses through his hand, causing the air 
to ripple, his hair whipping across his face. Sora is paralyzed as it 
draws near him and he closes his eyes, hearing a crash)

Goofy: Sora ain’t gonna go anywhere!

(Sora opens his eyes, seeing Goofy standing in front of him with his 
shield out. The energy, upon contact with the shield, has fizzled into 
the air around him)

Riku: You’d betray your king?

Goofy: Not on your life! But I’m not gonna betray Sora, either, ‘cause 
he’s become one of my best buddies after all we’ve been through together!

(He turns to look at Sora, giving him a thumbs up)

Goofy (waving): See ya later, Donald. Could ya tell the king I’m really sorry?

Donald: Hold on, Goofy! We’ll tell him together.

(He runs over to the two of them and looks up at Sora)

Donald: Well, you know... All for one and one for all.

Goofy: I guess you’re stuck with us, Sora.

Sora (staring at the floor): Thanks a lot... Donald, Goofy.

Riku: How will you fight without a weapon?

(Sora looks back up at him)

Sora: I know now I don’t need the Keyblade. I’ve got a better weapon. 
My heart.

(Riku scoffs)

Riku: Your heart? What good will that weak little thing do for you?

Sora: All though my heart may be weak, it’s not alone. It’s grown with 
each new experience, and it’s found a home with all the friends I’ve 
made. I’ve become a part of their heart just as they’ve become a part 
of mine. And if they think of me now and then...if they don’t forget 
me...then our hearts will be one.

(He takes out the wooden sword)

Sora: I don’t need a weapon. My friends are my power!

(The Keyblade flashes in Riku’s hand, much to his surprise. It disappears 
and he stares at his hand, gasping in total astonishment. The Keyblade 
reappears in Sora’s hands, and he stares down at Riku, who takes out Soul 
Eater, his winged sword. Riku rushes forward attacking Sora in a flourish 
of hits. Sora dodges sideways and spins around, sliding back toward Riku 
and striking with his Keyblade. He reels back, landing on his right foot. 
Bending his knee, he pushes off and jumps into the air over Goofy. Riku 
lands back on the floor and strikes through Donald, knocking him out. He 
sends all his frustration into his sword as he slashes at Sora, who holds 
his Keyblade in two hands, blocking Riku’s blows. Seeing a free 
opportunity, he bashes Riku in the side with the blade, sending him 
flying backward toward the fountain in the center of the room)

Riku: No... Not yet...

(He bends over, breathing heavily. The darkness around his clothes fades 
and he runs away in disgrace. Beast enters the room behind them)

Beast: So, your heart won this battle.

(Sora nods and they continue through the castle. In the Castle Chapel, 
Riku runs over the cold stone floor out of breath)

Riku: Why? It was mine.

?????: Know this.

(He stops at the sound of the voice, catches his breath and turns around)

?????: The heart that is strong and true shall win the Keyblade.

(He sees a cloaked figure emerging from the darkness covered in an 
unearthly glow)

Riku: What? You’re saying my heart’s weaker than his?

(Riku glares at it in defiance)

?????: For that instant, it was.

(Riku’s eyes widen and he shakes his head, staring at the floor)

?????: However, you can become stronger.

(The figure walks closer to him, the X on its chest nearly visible)

?????: You showed no fear in stepping through the door to darkness. It 
held no terror for you. Plunge deeper into the darkness, and your heart 
will grow even stronger.

Riku: What should I do?

?????: It’s really quite simple. Open yourself to the darkness. That is 
all. Let your heart, your being become darkness itself.

(Riku glows with a green aura. He looks up at the figure, as it moves 
closer to him. Meanwhile, Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Beast ascend the castle. 
As they approach the Castle Chapel, Maleficent stands in the Grand Hall, 
gazing into the Dark Depths where the Keyhole lays in wait. Riku, in his 
dark clothing, walks to join her. He speaks, his voice taking on an eerie 
quality)

Riku: So, I see the path has emerged at last.

Maleficent: Yes. The Keyhole to the darkness.

(The great heart before them brims with energy)

Riku: Unlock it and the Heartless will overrun this world.

Maleficent: What do I care? The darkness holds no power over me. Rather, 
I will use its power to rule all worlds.

Riku: Such confidence.

(He holds up his hand and a dark Keyblade appears, the blade’s teeth 
forming the negative space of a heart. Maleficent gazes down at it, intrigued)

Maleficent: Oh!

(The Keyblade fails to react in the Keyhole presence, much to Maleficent’s 
annoyance)

Maleficent: Impossible! The princesses of heart are all here! It must be her.

(She turns back, her eyes narrowed in irritation, settling on the body 
of Kairi, sleeping on the floor. They walk over to her)

Riku: Without her heart, she will never be able to release her power.

(They hear a sound and look in the direction of the Castle Chapel)

Maleficent: The king’s fools are here. I’ll deal with them myself.

(She begins to walk away)

Maleficent: You stay here and guard the princesses.

(She gracefully exits as Riku watches her leave, a smirk appearing on 
his face as an unearthly glow surrounds him. Maleficent enters the 
chapel, coming face to face with Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Beast)

Maleficent: I’m afraid you’re too late. Any moment now, the final 
Keyhole will be unsealed. This world will be plunged into darkness. 
It is unstoppable.

(Her eyes flicker with her dark thoughts)

Sora (arming himself with the Keyblade): We’ll stop it! After coming 
this far, there’s no way we’re gonna let that happen!

(She glowers at his impertinence, slamming her staff against the stone floor)

Maleficent: You poor, simple fools. You think you can defeat me? Me, 
the mistress of all evil?

(She raises her arms and the platform underneath her rises out of the 
ground. It hovers in the air out of their reach. She taps her staff 
against it, and it sails across the room. The top of her staff sparks 
with green fire and she lifts it into the air, cackling)

Maleficent: Now you’ll know the meaning of fear! A bolt of lightning to 
strike them down!

(Violet lightning crackles on the ceiling, sending thunderbolts down on 
top of them. Donald sends a Gravira spell at the witch’s platform, 
causing it to crash to the floor. Maleficent recovers from the fall and 
they rush in and attack her)

Maleficent: No!

(She swipes at them with her staff, knocking Sora away)

Maleficent: Meteors of heaven, unleash thy fury!

(Behind her, a swirling vortex appears, and large meteors fly in towards 
them. The wind whips through Sora’s hair as they attempt to dodge the 
unending shower of rocks. Goofy covers himself with his shield as Beast 
is struck down by a meteor. Donald jumps away, but is sideswiped by 
another. As the witch cackles evilly, Sora stands his ground, placing 
a hand over his heart)

Sora: Give me strength!

(Sora spins the Keyblade in his hands, holding the blade upwards and 
turning it clockwise. The tip of the blade glows and magic swirls 
down the shaft. As it reaches the hilt, Tinker Bell emerges twirling 
in the air. She flies to Sora and touches his nose, healing him. He 
smiles as she twirls around him. Tink flies to Beast and heals him as 
Maleficent narrows her eyes)

Maleficent: Come out!

(Tinker Bell continues to heal the party as Heartless appear in the 
room. Maleficent raises her platform again, knocking Sora and Goofy 
off, floating to the other end of the room. Sora takes out the Heartless 
as Donald strikes the platform with another Gravira spell. Sora slides 
toward Maleficent and attacks her)

Maleficent: Away!

(A large bolt of lightning erupts from the ceiling, striking Sora at 
full force. He falls over, but Tinker Bell revives him and disappears. 
Donald attacks the witch with various spells as Goofy protects him. 
Just as she is about to summon another meteor shower, Beast lunges at 
her, claws bared)

Maleficent: No!

(She bends over, her breath coming short. A portal appears behind her 
and she walks through it. In a hidden room of the castle, Maleficent 
clutches her chest, using her staff for balance. Her breath came in 
tight as a corridor of darkness appeared behind where she tread. Riku 
steps out of it, the dark Keyblade in hand)

Riku: Do you need some help?

Sora: Riku!

(Sora and company enter and Riku turns to face them)

Donald: Is that—

Riku: Yes. A Keyblade.

(He holds it up)

Riku: But unlike yours, this Keyblade holds the power to unlock 
people’s hearts. Allow me to demonstrate... Behold!

(He stabs Maleficent in the chest with the Keyblade)

Maleficent: Wha—

(The witch’s chest floods with darkness)

Riku: Now, open your heart, surrender it to the darkness! Become 
darkness itself!

(He releases the Keyblade and retreats into a portal. Maleficent 
stands up straight, and quietly laughs to herself)

Maleficent: This is it! This power!

(She glows with a green aura, laughing)

Maleficent: Darkness... The true darkness!

(She erupts in green flames, sending them billowing higher into the 
air, her dark shadow etched in its smoky tendrils as her form changes. 
She grows larger, her black cloak expanding outward and filling with 
green. From her back, large wings push outward splitting to her sides, 
knocking the green from her body into sparks. The black wings connect 
with gray translucent skin to a large black body, heavily muscled and 
scaled. The dragon rears back on its hind legs and slams the ground, 
eyes and mouth a blazing yellow. Donald sends a Blizzara spell at the 
dragon, who brushes it off like nothing. Sora goes after the head as 
Beast charges forward, his roars echoing off the stone walls)

Beast: Step aside!

(His claws dig into the dragon’s flesh. The dragon screeches and spins, 
knocking them all back with her tail. The dragon’s mouth foams with 
green flame and it spew fire from its mouth, setting the room ablaze. 
Goofy throws his shield at her, but it only enrages the monster further. 
Donald continues shooting Blizzara spells to try to dampen the fire, 
while Sora searches for a way over the flames. He whirls around, his 
eyes settling on the thick vines lining the walls and starts climbing. 
The dragons screeches, Beast having made it angry enough. It rears 
back on its hind legs, conjuring fire at the base of its neck. The 
fireballs fly through the air towards Sora. Finding the highest point 
of the vines, Sora sees the fireballs coming at him. He sends a Blizzara 
spell, but it only takes out half of them. Donald sees this and conjures 
an Aero spell around Sora, protecting him from the rest of the fire. As 
Beast distracts the dragon, Sora kicks off the wall spiraling towards 
the creature. He spins and his Keyblade collides with the dragon, who 
thrashes in pain before crashing to the floor, sending ashes into the 
air. The thorny vines surrounding the room burst into green flame and 
disappear as Maleficent leaves nothing but her torn cloak behind. Riku 
walks over it)

Riku: How ironic. She was just another puppet after all.

Donald: What?

Riku: The Heartless were using Maleficent from the beginning. She 
failed to notice the darkness in her heart eating away at her. A 
fitting end for such a fool.

(He grounds his foot into the floor and the cloak disappears. He 
backs away into a corridor of darkness. Sora finds a summon gem and 
they return to the Castle Chapel, where a hidden entrance appears. 
They follow it to the Grand Hall, where they see the princesses 
encapsulated. They run up the stairs to the main area in front of 
the great heart, where Kairi sleeps. A barrier prevents Beast and 
Goofy’s entry, to Donald’s surprise)

Sora: Kairi!

(Sora rushes over and kneels beside her, lifting her into his arms)

Sora (gently shaking her): Kairi! Kairi! Open your eyes!

Riku: It’s no use.

(Sora looks up, seeing Riku sitting above the great heart)

Riku: That girl has lost her heart. She cannot wake up.

(Sora sets Kairi down softly, sensing the darkness in Riku’s voice)

Sora: What? You... You’re not Riku.

Riku: The Keyhole cannot be completed so long as the last princess of 
heart still sleeps.

(He drops down off his seat, falling in front of the dark depths)

Sora (looking down at her): The princess...? Kairi’s a princess?

Riku: Yes, and without her power, the Keyhole will remain incomplete. 
It is time she awakened.

Sora: Whoever you are, let Riku go! Give him back his heart!

Riku: But first, you must give the princess back her heart.

(He points his Keyblade at Sora, who clutches his chest and falls to 
the floor, catching himself)

Donald: Sora!

Sora: What’s—

Riku: Don’t you see yet?

(He descends the stairs in their direction)

Riku: The princess’s heart is responding. It has been there all along. 
Kairi’s heart rests within you!

Sora: Kairi... Kairi’s inside me?

(He looks down at her body)

Riku: I know all that there is to know.

Sora: Tell me. Who are you?

Riku (smiling): It is I, Ansem, the seeker of darkness.

(He walks toward Sora, prompting Donald to yell out and rush at him, 
but simply knocks the duck past the barrier and moves on. He stands 
over Sora, looking down with euphoria, and points his Keyblade toward him)

Ansem: So, I shall release you now, Princess. Complete the Keyhole 
with your power. Open the door, lead me into everlasting darkness!

(With a mad look in his eye, Ansem lifts the Keyblade, about to strike)

Kairi: Sora!

(Sora raises his Keyblade and blocks the strike. Ansem grits his teeth, 
putting more pressure on the blade)

Sora (standing): Forget it! There’s no way you’re taking Kairi’s heart!

(He knocks back Ansem’s blade, who extends an arm)

Ansem: Come!

(Sora strikes, hitting him square in the side. He winces, but recovers, 
blocking a further attack. He tries to toy with Sora, forcing him to 
strike first and dodging at the last minute. Sora blocks his next 
strike and sends a Thunder spell at Ansem, who responds with a dark 
fireball that hits Sora straight in the chest)

Ansem: Now witness true power!

(An aura surrounds him and he floats into the air, his left hand glowing. 
He plunges his Keyblade into the ground, unleashing lightning shockwaves 
from the floor. Ansem’s eyes are wide with madness and he laughs as he 
fights Sora. He swipes the Keyblade down, sending a blade of energy 
surging toward Sora, who deploys an Aero spell)

Ansem: Behold the power of darkness!

(Ansem starts running impossibly fast, pelting Sora with blow after blow 
from his Keyblade as he rushes around the room. Sora endures the blows, 
waiting for the chance to strike. He heals as soon as he can and once 
Ansem stops running, tosses the Keyblade at him, hitting him square in 
the face. Riku’s body disappears, leaving behind the dark Keyblade)

Sora: Riku!

(The barrier is gone and Donald and Goofy stand in front of the 
entrance to the Dark Depths)

Donald: Sora! Sora, look!

Goofy: The... The Keyhole!

(Sora walks over to it and aims his Keyblade, which doesn’t respond)

Goofy: It won’t work! The Keyhole’s not finished yet!

(Sora puts his Keyblade away)

Sora: What can we do?

Goofy: Maybe we’ve gotta go wake Kairi up.

Sora: I think you’re right.

(They turn in her direction and Sora places his hand on his chest)

Sora: If we can free her heart... But... But how?

(His eyes settle on the dark Keyblade)

Sora: A Keyblade that unlocks people’s hearts... I wonder.

Goofy: Sora?

(Sora walks over to the Keyblade and picks it up)

Goofy: Sora, hold on!

Donald: No, wait!

(He smiles at them and holds the blade in both hands, stabbing himself 
in the chest. His chest glows brightly and the Keyblade floats out of 
him. He closes his eyes and starts to fall backwards. The dark 
Keyblade splits into six hearts, that float back into the princesses. 
Another heart surges from Sora’s chest and floats back to Kairi, who 
opens her eyes. The entrance to the Dark Depths shimmers, the barrier 
broken, and Sora glows brightly, slowly falling. Donald runs toward him)

Donald: Sora... Sora!

(Kairi jumps to her feet)

Kairi: Sora!

(She runs to Sora, but as she touches him, he bursts into a million 
points of light, which float into the air and disappear, leaving Kairi 
in shock)

Donald (shouting): Sora! Come back, Sora!

(Sora floats through an endless abyss)

Sora: What’s... What’s happening to me? Falling...falling...into darkness.

(Kairi, Donald, and Goofy stand motionless, waiting for any sort of sign)

Kairi: Sora, are you really—No. He can’t be! I won’t let him go!

(A corridor of darkness appears and a tall man with silver hair and 
orange eyes steps out)

Ansem: So, you have awakened at last, Princess. The Keyhole is now 
complete. You have served your purpose. But now it’s over.

(He walks slowly towards Kairi, and Donald and Goofy brandish their weapons)

Donald: Don’t make another move!

Goofy (to Donald): Do you think we can stop him all by ourselves?

Donald: I don’t know!

(As he approaches, he stops, struggling to move his own body)

Ansem: Impossible...

(He grunts, a prisoner in his own body. An image of Riku appears before 
him, facing the other three)

Riku: No. You won’t use me for this!

(Riku holds out his arms, blocking Ansem from proceeding further but 
also shielding them from him)

Kairi: Riku!

Riku: You’ve got to run! The Heartless are coming!

(A horde of Shadow Heartless appear and surround them. Kairi touches 
her necklace and nods. Donald screams as the three of them escape from 
the Grand Hall)

Goofy: What about the Keyhole?

Donald: Let’s just get out of here!

(A lone Shadow watches them leave, its antennae wriggling in front of 
its glowing eyes. It jumps down from the upper platform in their direction. 
In the Entrance Hall, Donald and Goofy wait at the castle gates while 
Kairi stops at the head of the stairs)

Goofy: Kairi, hurry!

Kairi: I can’t leave them behind!

Donald: We can’t stay here!

(She runs down the stairs as the Shadow appears in the hall)
</pre><pre id="faqspan-6">Goofy: A Heartless is after us!

Donald: I’ll take care of him!

(The Heartless descends towards them and Donald hits it on the head 
with his magic wand)

Donald: Confounded Heartless! Get lost, will ya?

(It appears unfazed and looks over at Kairi. There is something about 
this Heartless, something different, and Kairi can feel it. However 
strange, however impossible, she knows it to be true)

Kairi: Sora? Is that you?

(The group is suddenly surrounded by Shadows)

Goofy: Uh-oh!

(Goofy and Donald rush to fight them as Kairi stands back, bravely 
shielding the little Heartless)

Kairi: This time, I’ll protect you.

(The Heartless surrounding her slowly move closer to their prey. They 
pause, their antennae and glowing eyes taking in every sense. They 
pounce and Kairi whirls around, putting her arms around the lone Shadow, 
her eyes clenched shut)

Kairi: Sora!

(Goofy and Donald defeat the rest and turn to see the group of Shadows 
covering Kairi. Donald lets off a worried squawk)

Goofy: Kairi!

(A light erupts from beneath the dark cloud, knocking the Heartless 
away, revealing Kairi in the arms of Sora)

Sora: Kairi, thank you.

(He holds her close as sparkles of light float around them. Kairi opens 
her eyes in amazement)

Kairi: Sora...

Donald &amp; Goofy: Sora!

(The Heartless around them reappear and everyone braces for a fight. Beast 
arrives, roaring loudly on top of the dragon fountain. He leaps down to 
their level and knocks away a Shadow)

Beast: Go! Now!

Sora: Come with us!

Beast: I told you before, I’m not leaving without Belle. Now, go! The 
Heartless are coming!

Sora: All right. Let’s get out of here.

(They race out of the castle and back to Traverse Town. They gather with 
Leon, Aerith, and Yuffie in the Small House in the Third District)

Leon: Tell me what happened.

(They recount the events of Hollow Bastion)

Leon: So the darkness is flowing out of that Keyhole...

Aerith: No wonder there are more and more Heartless everywhere. The only 
way to stop them is—

Sora (holding up his Keyblade): Seal the Keyhole, right?

Leon: Maybe. But no one knows what will happen once it’s sealed.

Sora (concerned): Well, we can’t just stay here. We have to do something. 
I’ve got a friend back there.

Leon: That’s right. You have one more friend to worry about. Riku’s 
Keyblade must have been born of the captive princesses’ hearts—just 
like that Keyhole you saw.

(He looks up at Kairi)

Leon: Of course, without Kairi’s heart, it remained incomplete. Once 
that Keyblade was destroyed, the princesses’ hearts should have been 
freed. Don’t worry, Sora. If anyone can save your friend, you can.

Yuffie: Not sure why, but the Heartless are getting stronger. New types 
of Heartless are popping up all over the place! If anything happens to 
us, I know we can count on you, Sora.

Kairi: Even in your Heartless form, I knew it was you.

Aerith: I thought the Keyhole would strength the darkness. I mean the 
darkness is strong, but still... It’s almost as if someone is holding 
the darkness back.

Leon: It seems the other princesses have been freed as well. Jasmine 
apparently hasn’t returned to Agrabah. I suspect the others are still 
in the castle, too.

(Sora speaks to Aerith)

Aerith: Do you remember seeing a man with spiky hair at the coliseum?

Sora: Yup.

Aerith: I wonder if he’s still searching for his friend? Sora. If you 
see him, please tell him to be careful. He’s not that friendly, but we 
all care about him dearly.

(They find Cid in the First District)

Sora: Cid, I need to go back to Hollow Bastion.

Cid: I don’t think I can let you do that, kid. The Heartless there are 
multiplying by the minute. They’d eat your ship up.

Sora: Then what can we do?

Cid: Simple. Go around ‘em instead of through. Install a new navigation 
gummi and take a new route.

Sora: A new gummi? From where?

Cid: The secret waterway. When I came here 9 years ago, I stored it 
there in case I ever needed it. Never thought a kid would be the one to 
use it!

(Sora, Donald, and Goofy enters the Secret Waterway, seeing Kairi there. 
She stares down the cave to a painting of the sun)

Kairi: What a mysterious mural... It’s almost hypnotizing.

(Sora walks up to the mural, which starts to glow. It changes into a 
crescent moon and a small gummi block floats out of it, landing in Sora’s 
hands. Sora returns to Kairi)

Sora: Let’s go back and join the others. We should rest up

Kairi: Okay.

(She stares at the mural of the moon as Donald and Goofy leave the two alone)

Kairi: A light at the end of the tunnel...

Sora: Oh, your grandma’s story, right?

Kairi: That’s right. We were together.

Sora: You know what’s funny? I looked everywhere for you, but you were 
with me all along. Finally, we’re together, Kairi.

(He walks closer to her)

Sora: Now, it’s time to get Riku back.

Kairi: You think it’ll ever be the same again between us? Riku’s lost his...

Sora: When I turned into a Heartless, you saved me, remember?

(An image of Sora floats in darkness)

Sora: I was lost in the darkness. I couldn’t find my way. As I stumbled 
through the dark, I started forgetting things—my friends, who I was. 
The darkness almost swallowed me. But then I heard a voice—your voice. 
You brought me back.

Kairi: I didn’t want to just forget about you, Sora. I couldn’t.

Sora: That’s it! Our hearts are connected.

(He puts a hand to his chest)

Sora: And the light from our hearts broke through the darkness. I saw 
that light. I think that’s what saved me. No matter how deep the darkness, 
a light shines within. I guess it’s more than just a fairy tale.

Kairi: Well, let’s go.

Sora: You can’t go.

Kairi: Why not?

Sora: Because it’s way too dangerous.

(Kairi stands with her hands behind her back)

Kairi: Come on, Sora. We made it this far by sticking together. You 
can’t go alone.

Sora: Kairi, even if we’re apart, we’re not alone anymore. Right?

Kairi: I can’t help?

Sora (chuckling): You’d kind of be in my way.

(Kairi giggles)

Kairi (smiling): Okay. You win.

(She grabs his hand and gives him something)

Kairi: Take this.

(He looks down, seeing a star-shaped keychain made of seashells)

Kairi (firmly): It’s my lucky charm. Be sure to bring it back to me.

Sora: Don’t worry. I will.

Kairi: Promise?

Sora: Promise.

Kairi: Don’t ever forget. Wherever you go, I’m always with you.

(Words echo down a dark and lonely road)

Riku: Sora... Kairi... I’m sorry...

(Riku walks alone in the darkness)

Riku: Is this the afterworld?

(He stumbles forward and his form shimmers)

Riku: I’m not ready. Not yet. Not until I see Sora and Kairi one last time...

(He hears a voice in the abyss)

?????: Riku, can you hear me? I’ll be there soon.

(He whirls around)

Riku: Who is that?

?????: I have the other Keyblade—the one that belongs to this world.

(Riku looks around, confused)

?????: I’ve been trying to get through to you, but the darkness in your 
heart kept me away.

Riku: Who are you? What’s happened to me?

?????: Your heart won the battle against the darkness, but it was too 
late for your body. That’s why you’re here—in this place of darkness 
where hearts are gathered.

Riku: So what do I do?

(He looks ahead down the winding road)

?????: The Door of Darkness will open soon, but it’s a door we can’t 
enter. It has to be closed from both sides. To do this, you need two 
keys and two hearts. Maybe you’re here for the same reason I am. Maybe 
it was fate.

Riku: Fate, huh? You seem to know everything, don’t you?  Then tell me: 
Are Sora and Kairi okay?

(An image of Sora runs toward him out of the darkness)

?????: Don’t you feel the echoes of their hearts? You already know the 
answer. Look inside your own heart.

(Riku opens his eyes)

Riku: Okay.

(Sora, Donald, and Goofy return to the First District and give Cid the 
navigation gummi)

Cid: You found it? All right, I’ll go fix up your ship.

(Cid leaves and Sora, Donald, and Goofy decide to visit Merlin’s Study 
while he works on the ship. Sora opens Pooh’s storybook and enters the 
100 Acre Wood. He arrives at a clearing crowded with tree stumps, where 
Tigger and a young kangaroo are practicing their bouncing. Owl flies in 
overhead as Sora sees a giant honey pot in the center of the clearing. He 
walks over to the seesaw where Tigger and Roo are bouncing)

Tigger: This here is my bouncin’ spot! We can bounce around here all day!

Roo: Nothing beats bouncin’! 

Tigger: You wanna bounce, too, Sora? It’s lotsa fun!

Sora: Okay!

Owl: To bounce with the finest, you’ll need some pointers from the finest.

(Owl decends to the seesaw and lands)

Roo: But, Owl, you don’t bounce around like we do!

Owl (sighing): I’m afraid you’re right. I can’t master everything, I suppose.

(Owl flies away)

Tigger: Bounce this way, please!

(He jumps onto a nearby tree stump and Roo follows him. Sora joins them and 
Tigger faces the course of tree stumps)

Tigger: Here’s a little warm-up.

(Tigger and Roo hop along the tree stumps to a cliff at the other end of 
the clearing. Sora follows them in the same pattern before they return to 
the original stump)

Tigger: Now it gets tricky!

(Tigger and Roo bounce along a different pattern, and Sora triumphs again)

Tigger: You’re doin’ fantastical! This’ll be the last one.

(Roo jumps over to the seesaw, followed by Tigger. Roo bounces on his 
side of the seesaw, sending Tigger up into the tree above them. Tigger 
bounces from the tree onto the tree stumps and back across to the cliff. 
Sora repeats the pattern and Tigger bounces with glee)

Tigger: You’ve gotten mighty good at bouncin’, Sora! Right, Roo?

Roo: Hey, Tigger! I think he’s ready for the big one!

Tigger: Well, there’s only one way to find out!

(Tigger bounces in the giant honey pot, tossing nuts at Sora, who whacks 
them back at the pot, shattering it. Tigger bounces out, laughing. Sora 
finds Pooh at the base of a hollow tree)

Pooh: This tree doesn’t have honey, I see.

(He finds Piglet near a wooden plank in the ground)

Piglet: I wonder what this is.

(He finds Owl standing near the entrance)

Owl: Rare nuts grow on these trees. I’ll trade you things for them.

(Sora collects the rare nuts in the area and brings them to Owl)

Owl: Look at all these nuts! We couldn’t have done it without you. What 
are they for? It’s a secret.

(Sora leaves the 100 Acre Wood and speaks to the Fairy Godmother)

Fairy Godmother: Oh, another summon gem? Let’s help this little one. Here 
we go! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

(Sora is granted the power to summon Mushu)

Fairy Godmother: Thank you, Sora. Here’s something for you.

(She gives Donald an upgraded wand)

Fairy Godmother: Take good care of them.

(They return to Cid, who’s waiting for them)

Cid: All set! You can get going any time. Kid, I gotta say, I wish you 
didn’t have to face all this danger. Don’t get cocky just ‘cause you’ve 
been there before. That castle’s probably crawling with ‘em now...

(They enter the gummi ship and are hailed by Chip and Dale on the 
communicator)

Chip: There’s a new warp hole near Traverse Town.

Dale: I wonder where it leads... Hmm. Some weird power is emanating from 
the worlds.

Chip: Might be worth revisiting some places again.

(Sora, Donald, and Goofy travel to the Olympus Coliseum to compete in 
the Hades Cup. They fight in 39 seeds of the tournament, when Hades appears 
in the arena)

Hades: Yo, hey, how’re you doin’ everybody, yeah. Got a minute? Hades, 
Lord of the Dead. Nice to see you. Hey, guess what? I got a place for you 
down under!

(Hades hovers around the arena, shooting fireballs at Sora, Donald, and 
Goofy. Donald responds with Blizzaga spells, which knock him back)

Hades: Feel the heat...

(He turns red, stretching his arms out and sending large torrents of 
flame out from them. He spins around, trying to hit them. Sora casts an 
Aero spell on everyone and dodge rolls through the flame. Goofy holds 
his shield in front of him as Hades slams his arms down sending fire onto 
him. Sora sends another Blizzaga spell at Hades and he reels back)

Hades: That all you’ve got?

(Hades sends another stream of fire out from his hands, knocking out 
Donald. Goofy throws his shield, hitting Hades in the head)

Hades: That’s it!

(He throws another fireball at Goofy, but Sora dashes in front of him, 
blocking it with his Keyblade, which sends the fireball straight back 
at Hades. The god of the Underworld falls unconscious and Sora delivers 
a string of blows with his Keyblade. He heals Donald and the three of 
them attack at once as Hades regains consciousness. Hades is sent flying 
back into the hypogeum. He stands up and shakes in fear)

Hades: Oh! Hey, kid, wh-what are you doing?

(He struggles in the darkness as something is set loose on him)

Hades: Stop! Hey, guys! G-Get away from me! Come on! Come on!

(The gates of the hypogeum clamp shut as roars are heard from beyond. 
Later, the final match of the Hades Cup begins as a large stone creature, 
the Rock Titan, smashes into the arena. Its two heads look down on them 
with one objective. It moves toward Sora, Donald, and Goofy, towering 
over them, sending shockwaves through the arena floor. Sora sends his 
Keyblade through the air, attacking the titan’s feet. Eventually, it 
falls on its back, its heads vulnerable to attack. Sora climbs on top 
of the titan and strikes them with Graviga spells. They try to swing at 
him and he dodges backward. The Rock Titan stands back up, lifting its 
arms. It slams them down into the ground, creating an enormous shockwave 
through the earth. Sora stumbles under the titan as it lifts its strong 
rocky leg)

Donald: Sora!

(Donald sends a Cura spell, healing Sora, and Goofy charges forward at 
full speed, knocking Sora out of the way of the titan’s foot as it came 
crashing down. Goofy falls unconscious as the Rock Titan roars into the 
air. Sora glares at the creature and feels energy welling up inside him. 
He strikes its leg, knocking it over once again as Donald pulls Goofy to 
safety. Sora jumps on top of it and sends out a flurry of attacks until 
the Rock Titan crumbles. Sora covers his eyes as dust blows everywhere 
as Goofy is healed. Sora looks around, hearing a rumbling sound as the 
air grows cold. A large icy hand smashes onto the wall of the arena, 
shortly followed by another, before the towering Ice Titan rears its 
ugly head over the wall. Sora backs away slowly and the titan slams its 
foot down onto the floor of the arena, spreading its icy power along the 
floor. It roars at them, staring at them through emotionless eyes, 
blowing icy wind through the air. It begins shooting ice shards at the 
group, causing Donald to send back Fira spells. Goofy deflects the ice 
with his shield, forcing the titan to fall to its knees. Sora moves in 
and delivers a string of blows to the titan’s head. It roars again and 
sends a flurry of ice shards at everyone. Donald casts Aerora on the 
group and Sora sends Fira spells at the monster. It hisses as the ice 
shards expand larger when hitting the shields of wind surrounding them. 
An icy mist surrounds Sora and before he could move, he was frozen on 
the spot. The Ice Titan stomps on the ground, moving closer to him, 
sending shockwaves through its feet)

Donald: Sora!

(He sends a Fira spell at Sora, breaking him out of the ice in time to 
slam his Keyblade into the foot of the Ice Titan. It clamps its hands 
onto its head, slowly shrinking, surrounded by a dense cold air. It 
punches its foot into the ground, but its leg breaks and the ice in 
the ground dissipates. It stares confused, hearing a set of rumbling 
sounds. It looks up, seeing Sora towering over him, and reels back in 
fear. Sora moves to step on it, but it falls over just in time to miss 
his giant foot. The creature runs away, trailing dust, and jumps through 
the gate at the end of the arena. The three celebrate as Hades grumbles 
behind the gate of the hypogeum. Donald jumps up, sending a Blizzaga 
spell at Hades’s hair, blowing out the flame much to the god’s surprise. 
Sora holds the Hades Cup trophy and looks over to a smiling Hercules 
as Phil laughs proudly. Later, they travel back to Hollow Bastion by 
a new route and disembark at the Rising Falls, where Beast waits for them)

Sora: Where’s Belle?

Beast: Still in the castle.

Goofy: Against her will?

Beast: No, I think she stayed for a reason. The other princesses are 
inside as well.

Donald: I wonder why?

Sora: Let’s go ask them.

Beast: You may need my strength. I’ll go with you.

(They make their way up to the castle. They enter the library and 
Beast walks slowly up the stairs. Belle turns away from a bookcase 
to face him and his eyes light up)

Beast: Belle!

(They walk over to each other and embrace. Sora, Donald, and Goofy join them)

Belle: You’ve come to seal the Keyhole, right? Please, be careful. The 
darkness is raging deep inside. We’ve been holding it back, but we 
can’t hold out much longer.

Sora: We’ll take care of it.

Belle: This is for you. Use it to face the darkness, as the Beast has.

(She hands him a rose-shaped Keychain)

Belle: So many books, but not one on how to banish the darkness. Maybe 
it’s hopeless... 

(They continue on to the Castle Chapel, where the rest of the princesses 
of heart are gathered. They talk to Aurora and Cinderella)

Cinderella: We’ve been waiting for you, Keyblade master.

Sora: Where’s Ansem?

Cinderella: Gone.

Aurora: When the Keyhole appeared, darkness poured out of it. It swallowed 
Ansem, and he disappeared.

Cinderella: Though Ansem is gone, the flood of darkness hasn’t stopped. 
We’re working together to hold it back.

Aurora: I cannot forget the look on his face. As the darkness engulfed 
him, he was smiling.

(They talk to Jasmine, Alice, and Snow White)

Jasmine: Sora, please hurry! Darkness is pouring from the Keyhole.

Alice: It’s all we can do just to hold back the darkness.

Snow White: I don’t even know how long we can manage even that.

Sora: All right, I’m on my way.

Snow White: We’re counting on you, Keyblade master. In the meantime, 
we’ll do what we can, too.

Aurora: Ansem has ignored us since the Keyhole appeared.

Cinderella: I don’t think Ansem will ever return.

Alice: We must close the Keyhole before it’s too late.

Jasmine: Can you feel the immense power flowing from that Keyhole?

Snow White: Please hurry. Our strength is running out.

(Sora, Donald, Goofy and Beast battle Heartless through the Grand Hall 
and enter the Dark Depths to find the Keyhole. They run in and find 
themselves face-to-face with an enormous Behemoth Heartless. They subdue 
the giant horned enemy by destroying its horn. It disappears and they 
see a large Heartless insignia in the abyss with a Keyhole embedded in it)

Goofy: Now let’s go and seal that big Keyhole!

????: Sora. You did it.

(They turn around and leave the Dark Depths to find the source of 
the voice. In the Grand Hall, they see Leon, Yuffie, and Aerith)

Sora: What are you guys doing here?

Yuffie: We came in Cid’s ship.

Aerith: This is our childhood home. We wanted to see it again.

Leon: It’s in worse shape than I feared. It used to be so peaceful...

Aerith: Don’t worry. If we defeat Ansem, all should be restored. 
Including your island.

Sora: Really?

Yuffie: But, it also means goodbye.

Aerith: Once the worlds are restored, they’ll all be separate again.

Yuffie: Everyone will go back to where they came from.

Sora: Then I’ll visit you guys with the gummi ship.

Leon (crossing his arms): It’s not that simple.

Yuffie: Before all this, you didn’t know about the other worlds, right?

Aerith: Because every world was isolated. Impassable walls divided them.

Yuffie: The Heartless destroyed those walls. But if the worlds return, 
so will the walls.

Leon: Which means gummi ships will be useless.

Sora: So you’re saying we’ll never...?

(Their faces become sad)

Leon: We may never meet again, but we’ll never forget each other.

Aerith: No matter where we are, our hearts will bring us together again.

Yuffie: Besides, I couldn’t forget you even if I wanted to.

Sora: What’s that supposed to mean?

Donald: Sora!

(Sora looks to Donald and Goofy near the Dark Depths, where darkness is 
pouring out)

Goofy: Hurry! Come and close the Keyhole!

Leon: Sora, good luck.

(Sora nods to him and runs back to Donald and Goofy. They approach the 
final glowing Keyhole and Sora locks it. The Heartless symbol disappears. 
They meet back up with the princesses in the chapel)

Alice: Thank you, Sora. I think the darkness has begun to weaken.

Jasmine: But I can feel a powerful darkness growing somewhere far away.

Aurora: It’s the heart of the darkness. It must be where Ansem went.

Sora: Then we’ll take the gummi ship and deal with both Ansem and the 
Heartless.

Cinderella: A worthy answer, Keyblade master. We offer this power to aid 
your battle.

(Cinderella upgrades Sora’s Fira spell)

Snow White: Sora, your courage can bring back our worlds.

Aurora: Once the darkness is gone, all should return to its original state.

Sora: Kairi will be back on the island?

Cinderella: Most certainly. And you should be, too.

Sora: I can’t go home ‘til I find Riku and the king.

Cinderella: I still can’t believe we played a part in opening the Keyhole. 
To think we had such a power... Simply unimaginable! My world is gone, so 
I suppose I must stay here for the time being.

Alice: The darkness still lingers, so we’ll stay as well. Otherwise, this 
world will be destroyed, too. We’ll do all we can. You helped me during that 
silly trial. Now it’s my turn to help you.

Aurora: Maleficent used to live in our world. She used her great powers to 
control the darkness... But eventually it came to control her. I’m so glad 
the others are here with me.

Snow Whtie: The darkness took my home. I don’t know where to go now. I hope 
my loved ones are safe somewhere. I’ll do whatever I can to keep this world 
from being taken, too. I just want everything back as it was before.

Jasmine: Please don’t tell Aladdin about all this. He will worry to death 
if you do! I will tell him about it, once I return to Agrabah. I hope 
everything is all right in Agrabah.

(Sora and company return to the Library and speak to Aerith)

Aerith: Sora, you should read this.

Sora: Read what?

Aerith: It’s the rest of Ansem’s report. Maleficent must have collected it.

(She hands him the report)

Aerith: Ansem disappeared when this world fell to the darkness. It was 
believed he died defending people from the Heartless. But Ansem was the 
one who brought them here. Ansem waits in darkness. But here’s a little 
light to protect you, Sora.

(She upgrades his healing spell)

Aerith: Read that report and you’ll understand Ansem’s intentions. I 
believe the worlds can be restored. They are still alive.

(They speak to Leon and Yuffie)

Yuffie: Ansem and Maleficent were both possessed by darkness. You know, 
I just don’t get it. What’s so great about the darkness?

Leon: This was once Ansem’s castle. He was widely respected as a wise 
man. But darkness took him. He began experimenting with people’s hearts. 
Heh, some wise man. So much suffering and ruin, and for what?

Yuffie: This is my home, but it just doesn’t feel like it. I don’t 
remember much, ‘cause I was only a kid.

Leon: We thought this was Maleficent’s doing. But she was just another 
puppet of the darkness. Just like Ansem. This darkness is our real enemy. 
But how to beat it? Well, first things first. Let’s purge every last 
Heartless we can find.

Yuffie: There are no Heartless here, so rest up. We’ve gotta get rid of 
the Heartless and rebuild this world.

Leon: I won’t use my real name until this world is restored.

(They speak to Belle)

Belle: Ansem desires the darkness. He thinks it’s the source of all 
power. What nonsense. Darkness may shroud light, but it can never 
extinguish it. Sora, don’t succumb to the darkness. You and the Keyblade 
can defeat it.

(Sora, Donald, and Goofy return to the Olympus Coliseum, where a special 
enemy has appeared. Sora runs into the arena, looking around. A large 
portal appears in the sky, sending a beam down to the ground. Through 
the brightness, Sora could see a man with long silver hair. The man 
stands up slowly, a wing protruding from right side of his back. He 
stretches out his arm and the wing follows suit. Sora stares as Sephiroth 
faces him, smiling through sinister eyes. He slowly places a hand on 
the elongated nodachi sheathed at his hip. He stands far from Sora, but 
as he unsheathes the sword, he strikes Sora from afar. Sora rushes him 
and attacks, before dodging away as the man’s range overtakes him. 
Sephiroth conjures pillars of flame around him, but Sora jumps away 
nearly scorched. Dozens of dark orbs surround the man, making it harder 
for Sora to strike at him. He sends a Firaga spell, taking out some of 
them, before sending down lightning bolts with Thundaga. Sephiroth leaps 
into the air and slashes at Sora in quick succession. He lands on the 
ground and glows with a white aura as several meteors crash down from 
the sky around him. Sora concentrates and flies into the air as the 
meteors orbit around the man. Sora stays in the air out of the way of 
the rocks. A black hole spins above Sephiroth’s head, absorbing the 
meteors and the man begins teleporting around striking Sora and 
retreating. While a good distance away from Sora, Sephiroth floats 
into the air chanting, but before he finishes, Sora tosses his Keyblade 
at him, knocking him to the ground. He stumbles back, clutching his 
stomach. He stares at Sora and floats into the air. He stretches out 
his arms as a light erupts from him. The air around him ripples and 
the mysterious man disappears. Later, Cloud walks into the Coliseum 
arena with his buster sword out, a serious look on his face. He stops, 
seeing a blue feather fall from the sky. As the feather lands, Cloud 
looks up, his eyes making contact with Sephiroth. They stare each other 
down, neither making a move)

Cloud: I’ve been looking for you.

Sephiroth: As have I.

Cloud: As long as you exist, I’ll never wake from this nightmare. You’re 
my darkness.

Sephiroth (extending his arms): I’m a part of you, am I? Then join me 
in this eternal nightmare untarnished by light.

(Cloud brandishes his sword and Sephiroth closes his eyes, slowly 
grasping his blade. The tension in the air rises as electricity crackles 
around the two opponents, sending dirt into the air. Suddenly, they 
charge and their swords clash violently, their single wings extending 
and sending them airborne. They trade blows over and over, neither 
side gaining the upper hand. They split apart and Cloud charges, this 
time pushing Sephiroth back. Before his blade hits him, Sephiroth 
teleports away, leaving only feathers. Cloud looks up, glaring at 
Sephiroth who extends a hand to him. He smiles, only angering Cloud 
further, and the two soldiers clash swords, sending out a white hot 
light through the sky. At this time, a portal appears in the Castle 
Chapel at Hollow Bastion, alerting the princesses to its presence)

Cinderella: Could the appearance of that gate be a bad omen?

Snow White: There’s an ominous presence beyond the gate.

Alice: What is this feeling? It’s different from darkness... Be careful, Sora!

Aurora: I sense a presence coming from that gate... But it’s not 
darkness. It’s another power altogether. It may be even more dangerous 
than darkness.

Jasmine: We could suppress the power if it were darkness. But this 
is different. It’s a force unlike darkness... A force different from 
both the light and the darkness.

(Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Beast enter the portal, finding themselves 
in the room where Maleficent was defeated. An invisible figure shimmers 
in the air behind them, walking closer towards Sora, who turns and 
gasps as a man in a black cloak walks right through him. The world 
freezes and memories flash through Sora’s mind in rapid succession)

“No problem. Let’s do it!
Hold on! What’s that over there?
She arrived on the night of the meteor shower!
A huge black thing swallowed me up.
So, you’re from another world?
A paopu fruit...
What? There’s no way you’re getting this!
I’m so glad that you’re okay, Kairi.
The Keyblade...
The Heartless?
I wonder if I could find Riku and Kairi...
Anyway, she’s not the one you’re looking for.
That’s the power of the Keyblade!
Now I finally know what you mean about strength of heart.
Right, my friends!
Sorry about what I said.
Guess you don’t get out much, huh?
I promise.
You’re stupid. Sooner or later they’ll swallow your heart.
I’ve finally found her.
I still can’t believe it.
I know this place...
No. Not without Kairi.
I know now I don’t need a Keyblade.
I don’t need a weapon. My friends are my power!
Give him back his heart!
There’s no way you’re taking Kairi’s heart!
A Keyblade that unlocks people’s hearts... I wonder.
What’s... What’s happening to me?
Falling...falling...into darkness.
Kairi, thank you.
Now, it’s time to get Riku back.
Even if we’re apart, we’re not alone anymore.
Don’t worry. I will. Promise.”

(Sora falls to the cold stone floor, turning to see the cloaked figure stop)

Sora (standing): Who are you?

??????: Ah, it seems you are special, too.

Goofy: Ansem?

??????: That name rings familiar.

(An orb of energy erupts from his hand, crackling strongly, causing 
the air to ripple)

??????: You remind me of him.

Sora: What’s that supposed to mean?

(He gasps as the enigmatic man moves to aim the orb at him, and Sora 
summons his Keyblade. He holds it up just as the energy reaches the 
blade. It sizzles in the air, dissipated by the blade, sparks flying 
everywhere. Sora pushes it away, sending the orb soaring into the 
rafters of the tower, raining down mortar and stone. The man stares 
at Sora, fascinated by him)

??????: It means you are not whole.

(Sora grips the Keyblade tightly)

??????: You are incomplete. Allow me—to test your strength.

(The hooded figure conjures orbs of energy in both hands and flies at 
them in a flurry of darkness, the orbs exploding into giant damaging 
force fields, knocking Sora and his friends back. Sora slides back at 
the man and strikes, while Donald sends magic from a safe distance. The 
figure then teleports around the room, his speed increasing, surrounded 
by a dark cloud. The man summons red ethereal blades from his hands and 
spins closer to Sora, trying to strike him wild and violently. After a 
few more strikes, the man conjures a ring of blue lasers in the air, 
firing them towards Sora. He shrouds the room in darkness, sending out 
lasers from all around his body, nearly finishing off Goofy and the Beast. 
After forcefully dodging a numerous amount of attacks and countering with 
his own, the man’s chest glows with energy. He slashes out his hand and 
dispels it)

??????: Impressive.

(Sora’s eyes widen, surprised that the man is still standing)

??????: This will be enjoyable.

Sora: What are you talking about?

(Sora rushes the man and plants a foot on the ground, pushing off and into 
the air. Raising his Keyblade, the man walks forward through him and the 
world freezes for a second. Sora lands on the other side of the man, who 
simply stands there. Sora whirls around, scowling)

??????: It is beyond your comprehension, for now.

(The man turns in Sora’s direction)

??????: Until we meet again.

Sora: Wait, what are you—

(The mysterious man’s form flickers in the air, startling Sora)

??????: I am—

(Sora walks closer, and the man vanishes, the air rippling in his wake)

??????: ...but a mere shell.

(Sora, Donald, and Goofy return to Traverse Town to return the last group 
of Dalmatian puppies they found along their travels. They enter the 
Dalmatian’s House. A puppy runs up to Pongo and Perdita, looking much 
jollier than when Sora saw them last. It barks happily up at them. Sora 
enters the Living Room, seeing numerous puppies scattered around 
stretching, yawning, and playing. Pongo walks up to him and gives him a 
present. Perdita joins him and a puppy barks at their feet. In the 
Piano Room, dozens of puppies play on the piano, as more lay happily 
on the couch in the Den. Several run along the floor as Sora enters, 
and a bunch of them gather around him as he scratches his head. Pongo 
looks over at Perdita and then happily back at their 99 puppies safe and 
sound. Afterwards, they leave for Merlin’s Study. Sora enters the 100 
Acre Wood, arriving a a winding, muddy path. He finds Pooh, wandering 
in circles around a bramble bush, his footprints trailing him in the mud)

Sora: What are you doing, Pooh?

Pooh (pressing a finger to his lips): Shh. Quiet, or they’ll get away!

Sora: Who?

Pooh: The people who took everyone away. See their footprints? We were 
all sticking together to make sure no one got lost again. But then, I saw 
some footprints that needed following. So I did. Suddenly, everyone was 
gone. Bad people must have taken them away!

Sora: Actually, Pooh, I think those footprints are... Um... Anyway, I’ll 
help you look for your friends.

(He taps a fist against his chest proudly. Sora walks into the bramble 
bush, finding Eeyore)

Sora: Eeyore?

Eeyore: Hello.

Sora: What are you doing?

Eeyore: Lookin’ for sticks to build my house...again.

Sora: Sticks for your house?

(He looks around)

Sora: This place already feels like a house... Seems like a great spot 
to gather everyone once we find them.

(Sora leads Pooh around the muddy path, looking for his friends. Sora 
jumps on top of a well with a blustery wind surging from it. It lifts 
him into the air and tosses him to the top of the cliff. At the top, 
he sees Tigger bouncing along a log)

Tigger: I saw Pooh walkin’ away, so I bounced after him! Then I bounced 
a bit too high, and I lost sight of ol’ Pooh Bear!

(Sora brings Tigger back to the bramble bush. Sora sees Roo on top of a 
tree root, and he hops down to Sora)

Roo: I tried bouncin’ as high as Tigger. I was so busy tryin’ to bounce, 
I forgot to watch where I was bouncin’!

(Sora leads Roo back to the bush to join the others. Sora climbs the 
cliff again and finds Piglet hiding under a tree)

Sora: Hello, Piglet. So this is where you’ve been. Maybe I should bring 
Pooh along.

(Owl lands nearby and Sora catches him before he takes off again)

Owl: I thought I’d better have a word with Roo about his bouncing. The 
next thing I knew, quite to my surprise, I was lost, too!

(Sora returns Owl to the bush and leads Pooh to a patch of flowers. Pooh 
grabs them and they lure a group of butterflies, which carry him up to 
the top of the cliff. Sora sees Rabbit running in and out of holes in a 
cliff nearby)

Rabbit: Owl looked so intent on something, well, I just had to follow 
him! But then Owl flew off into the sky, and there I was, all by myself.

(They take Rabbit to the bramble bush. Sora leads Pooh over the log to 
the cliff on the other side, knocking down a bee’s nest in the way, and 
up to the tree where Piglet is hiding. Pooh walks under the tree and 
talks to Piglet)

Pooh: Hello, Piglet.

Piglet: Pooh! Where are we?

Pooh: I don’t know where we are either, Piglet. But if we go back the 
way we came, we should find home.

(Piglet appears in a hole at the bottom of the cliff)

Piglet: I got scared when everyone disappeared, so I hid.

(Sora leads Piglet into the bramble bush, and he trips over Eeyore’s 
foot. Pooh walks over)

Pooh: Everyone’s here!

(They walk to the Starry Hill as it gets darker out)

Piglet: I’m so glad we’re all together again.

(He laughs)

Piglet: I didn’t know what to do when I was all alone.

Tigger: Aw, Piglet, you gotta be brave.

Piglet: You weren’t lonely at all?

Tigger: Lonely? Are you kiddin’? I’m a Tigger! The most wonderful 
thing about Tiggers is I’m the only one. But I do admit, friends are 
awfully fun, too!

Pooh: Think, think, think.

(Sora looks over at Pooh, who taps his head)

Sora: Hey, Pooh, what are you thinking about now?

Pooh: Oh, well, I’m just thinking about what to think about.

Sora: Well, I’m off.

(He looks up at the stars)

Piglet: Sora, where are you going?

(Sora stands up and walks to the edge of the hill)

Sora: I’m gonna go look for my friends. They’re waiting for me.

(He looks back at them)

Tigger (happily): Bounce on back again!

Piglet: I hope you find your friends!

(Sora jumps off the hill and walks down the path. Pooh and his friends 
move to the edge of the cliff and watches him walk off. He stops and 
jabs his fist into the air, before looking back at them. They wave to him)

Pooh: Sora, don’t forget... We shall always be here.

(Sora leaves the 100 Acre Wood)

Pooh: If you’d like to visit again, that is.

(Magic shoots across the night sky and the book closes. Sora is now on 
the cover, holding hands with Pooh and Piglet as Tigger bounces along 
with them. The book’s latch closes and its Keyhole locks. Later, Sora 
sees Owl at Pooh’s house)

Owl: You’ve been a great help, Sora. Thank you! You helped Pooh get 
honey from the bees. You helped protect Rabbit’s carrots. You helped 
find Eeyore’s lost tail. You bounced along with Tigger and Roo. And you 
found all of us when we were lost. We can’t thank you enough. This is 
from all of us in the Hundred Acre Wood.

(He gives Sora an ability. Sora, Donald, and Goofy finally pilot the 
gummi ship to the End of the World. The disembark at the Gate to the 
Dark, a cave near fragments of dense snowy rocks floating in a pool of 
an unknown substance. A swirl of energy lights their destination)

Goofy: Gawrsh, is that all that’s left of the worlds taken by the Heartless?

Sora: Those worlds will be restored if we beat Ansem, right?

Donald: You betcha.

Sora: But, if we do beat him and all these worlds become restored and 
disconnected, what’s gonna happen to this place? And to us?

Donald: Well, uh...

Goofy: This is a Heartless world, so maybe it’ll just disappear.

(Sora and Donald look back at him)

Sora &amp; Donald: Huh?!

Goofy (hopeful): But no worries. Even if this place goes poof, our 
hearts ain’t goin’ nowhere. I’m sure we’ll find our pals again. Yup, 
I just know that we will.

(Donald nods in agreement)

Sora (nodding): Yeah, you’re right.

(He takes out Kairi’s wayfinder and stares at it, holding it tight)

Sora (thinking): I’ll return this. I promise.

(They proceed forward over the bizarre terrain. As they approach the 
swirling mist, a large dark orb falls from the sky, unclouding their 
vision. They are attacked by a Behemoth Heartless and find themselves 
in a wasteland of snow and crystal. Upon defeating the Behemoth, they 
drop into a Giant Crevasse filled with green web-like structures and 
crystals scattered throughout)

Goofy: I wonder where that Ansem feller went?

Donald: Dive into the most dangerous place and we’ll find him!

(At the bottom of the crevasse, they find a portal to a sharply formed 
cave with a flaming pillar burning in the center. They jump into the 
enchanted flame and find themselves in a long tiled hallway with a large 
Heartless insignia at the end of it. They defeat the Heartless that 
appear around them and a door opens in the wall, leading to a room with 
a mysterious device. On the panel of the device a message is written)

“Ones born of the heart and darkness, devoid of hearts, ravage all 
worlds and bring desolation. Seize all hearts and consummate the great 
heart. All hearts to be one, one heart to encompass all. Realize the 
destiny: the realm of Kingdom Hearts. The great darkness sealed within 
the great heart. Progeny of darkness, come back to the eternal darkness. 
For the heart of light shall unseal the path. Seven hearts, one Keyhole, 
one key to the door. The door of darkness, tied by two keys. The door 
of darkness to seal the light. None shall pass but shadows, returning 
to the darkness. Ones born of the heart and darkness, hunger for every 
heart until the dark door opens.”

(They return to the hallway and jump into the dark portal in the wall. 
Returning to the stark cave, the pillar of flame has become a swirling 
hole in the floor. They enter the hole and arrive in the Evil Grounds, 
where they float through the dark air. Beneath them is a curved figure 
with two giant wings. As they hover closer to it, its glowing eyes open 
and it spreads its wings out, stretching up to its full height. The 
demon Chernabog crosses its arms and showers them with its evil gaze. 
It stands in the caldera of a volcano, fire coursing through its veins. 
They fly towards the beast’s head and begin attacking It. It swipes a 
mighty claw at them, tossing them away before hunching over. They glide 
back to the demon and it raises its arms, roaring loudly as an enormous 
torrent of flames washes over them from the volcano, swirling voraciously 
around Chernabog. Donald sends a Blizzaga spell at the beast and it 
begins to spew fire from its mouth. They fly behind it and attack its 
neck, dodging another wall of fire. It knocks them away again and holds 
out its arms, spinning them in the air. Spirits appear, dancing near 
the end of its fingers, and it sends them after the trio. Donald casts 
Aeroga on everyone as they fly back into the fray, dodging the attacking 
spirits. After tussling with the dark demon, it roars and bursts into a 
pillar of white hot flames, flapping its huge wings for a final time 
before sinking into the volcano and vanishing. Sora, Donald, and Goofy 
float down through the crater where they find a white portal. They enter 
it and find themselves in a long tunnel filled with ruins. Dark vines 
line the walls, a grove of round trees in one corner and stone debris 
in another. They enter a second white portal and reach another corridor. 
Shadows of wicked trees cover the walls, their evil faces seemingly 
watching them as they traverse the somewhat darker tunnel. An image of 
a small door is etched in the wall. They enter another portal to another 
tunnel, the most hollow of all. The image of a castle is displayed on 
the wall, the entire cavern giving them an bleak feeling. They reach a 
large room with a Heartless symbol placed in the wall. A Behemoth appears, 
but they defeat it and walk over to the symbol. A piece breaks off and 
disappears. They defeat an almost endless horde of Heartless, with the 
pieces of the emblem deteriorating as they battle. Soon, the emblem 
shines and reveals a hidden room. They step into the sandy chamber, 
dust falling through holes in the walls. They see a large ornate door 
and something stirs in Sora’s memory)

Sora: Huh?

Donald: What’s wrong?

Sora: Don’t you hear something? There!

Voice: Careful. This is the last haven you’ll find here. Beyond, there 
is no light to protect you. But don’t be afraid. Your heart is the 
mightiest weapon of all. Remember, you are the one who will open the 
door to the light.

Donald: I don’t hear anything.

Sora: Strange... That voice was so familiar. Maybe it’s just my imagination.

Donald: Maybe you’d better take a rest!

(Sora steps forward and the doors open. From beyond, light streams in 
and engulfs the room. Sora’s eyes open to see a bright sandy beach where 
the clouds billow in the sky. The waves lap at the shore and he stands 
there in disbelief)

Sora: Is this... Is this my island?

(They approach the Secret Place, when they hear a voice dripping with 
darkness)

Ansem: This world has been connected.

(The small island off the beach disappears)

Goofy: What was that?

Ansem: Tied to the darkness... Soon to be completely eclipsed.

(The wooden area past the long bridge vanishes into thin air)

Ansem: There is so very much to learn.

(The ocean froths, turns a dark violet color)

Ansem: You understand so little.

(The island starts to rumble and quake)

Ansem: A meaningless effort. One who knows nothing can understand nothing.

(The island flashes and the sky rips open, shattering the peaceful 
illusion. Beyond the gashing tears is a dark, mad world. The beach 
crumbles and lifts out of the water, revealing its rocky undergrowth 
as what once was a dock splits in two. Ansem stands at the edge of the 
water, still in possession of Riku’s body. They run down to the beach 
where he stands motionless, staring out at the sea)

Ansem: Take a look at this tiny place. To the heart seeking freedom this 
is a prison surrounded by water. And so this boy sought out to escape from 
his prison.

(He raises his arms, looking upward, the wind gusting through his hair and 
clothes)

Ansem: He sought a way to cross over into other worlds. And he opened his 
heart to darkness.

(Ansem turns and Riku’s body melts away, revealing the true form of the 
man, the Heartless symbol emblazoned on his chest)

Sora (reaching out to him): Riku!

Ansem: Don’t bother. Your voice can no longer reach him where he is. His 
heart belongs again to darkness. All worlds begin in darkness, and all so 
end. The heart is no different.

(His voice amplifies in volume and audacity as he continues)

Ansem: Darkness sprouts within it, it grows, consumes it. Such is its 
nature. In the end, every heart returns to the darkness whence it came.

(They hear his voice behind them and whirl around as he speaks, having 
teleported. Sora jumps back)

Ansem: You see, darkness is the heart’s true essence.

Sora: That’s not true! The heart may be weak. And sometimes it may even 
give in. But I’ve learned that deep down, there’s a light that never goes out!

(Ansem rises into the air, crossing his arms. He stares down at them 
through piercing orange eyes)

Ansem: So, you have come this far and still you understand nothing. Every 
light must fade, every heart return to darkness!

(Behind him, darkness bursts from his body, forming into a large black 
Heartless with long antennae. It's teeth are bared, seemingly covered 
in thick constraints, while its torso forms an empty heart. Ansem laughs 
and the Heartless throws scythes of energy at them. Sora dodges them, 
rolling to the side as Ansem floats above them. Sora moves in, striking 
the man)

Ansem: Come, Guardian!

(The Heartless swoops in front of him, taking the blows from Sora’s 
Keyblade. Donald casts Thundaga and Graviga at Ansem, but the man just 
laughs at him. Ansem floats down to them and the Guardian swipes at 
them with a large hand. The fight continues until Ansem flies toward 
the large tree on the island, which starts to rumble. The branches 
shake violently as the tree is rent asunder, splitting into a corrupt 
area of vine and sinew. Ansem waits inside with the Guardian. Sora, 
Donald, and Goofy run up to the area, but Donald and Goofy are blocked 
by a barrier. The island shakes and the great black shape of Darkside 
rises from the floor, its wings stretching out behind it. Sora fights 
and defeats the giant Heartless, prompting Ansem to emerge from the shadows)

Ansem: Submit!

(The Guardian claws at Sora, turning into energy and latching onto Sora. 
Sora approaches Ansem, who bursts into a giant orb of energy, electricity 
crackling around it)

Ansem: Come. Open your heart...

(The orb slams into Sora, who falls back. He tries to strike Ansem, but 
the Guardian freezes him in place. Sora maintains his distance until the 
Guardian returns to Ansem’s side. Ansem shouts and the Guardian swings 
its arms, sending waves of energy at Sora, who rolls away from them. Ansem 
glows with a bright aura and the room grows dark) 

Ansem: My strength returns.

(The Guardian sinks into the ground and a pool of darkness appears 
underneath Sora. Sora looks down as the Guardian flies up at him, 
knocking him over. Sora dodges to his feet and jumps in the air. He 
flies forward as the Guardian continues its assault. As soon as it 
returns to Ansem’s side, Sora whirls around and runs straight at the 
man, striking him with the Keyblade. Ansem tries to hide behind his 
Guardian, but Sora predicts this, and with a spinning motion, slams the 
Keyblade into Ansem’s back. Ansem says nothing, and the world goes black)

Sora: Wha...?

(Staring through darkness, Sora, Donald, and Goofy float in midair)

Ansem: Behold the endless abyss! Within it lies the heart of all worlds:

(They look over and see a torn rock through the blackness, where an 
immense white door stands closed)

Ansem: Kingdom Hearts! Look as hard as you are able. You’ll not find 
even the smallest glimmer of light. From those dark depths are all hearts 
born. Even yours.

(They look down to see the colossal mass that is the World of Chaos, 
covered in muscle, bone, and sinew. At the top, Ansem hovers, connected 
by veins to the World of Chaos, as the Guardian grins behind him, his 
giant claws hanging at his sides. Both of them have grown larger and 
Ansem, less human)

Ansem: Darkness conquers all worlds!

(With this sight having struck fear into their hearts, Sora, Donald, 
and Goofy begin to fall towards it, a portal appearing above the cage-
like middle of the battleship. Donald and Goofy scream as they plunge 
inside it, while Sora falls into the black abyss. Riku’s words appear 
in his head)

Riku: Giving up already? Come on, Sora. I thought you were stronger 
than that.

(This calms his mind and he believes in himself again. He believes that 
he can defeat Ansem. He believes... And suddenly, he shoots back out of 
the darkness, flying up towards Ansem, and takes out the Keyblade, an 
unwavering look upon his face. Ansem stares at him with red-orange eyes, 
haunting, pupil-less in form, as he holds a double-edged pole sword in 
his hand. Sora flies forward, striking Ansem with the Keyblade)

Ansem: Turn to darkness!

(He swings the pole sword around in wild circles, striking Sora in the side)

Ansem: All shall be extinguished.
</pre><pre id="faqspan-7">(Orbs appear around Sora, and before he has a chance to duck, he is hit 
by a cluster of lasers. Sora flies downward away from them, but also 
away from Ansem)

Ansem: Come forth.

(Ansem swings his hand, summoning Bit Sniper Heartless, which fly after 
Sora, their bat-like wings flapping in the air. They try to sideswipe him, 
but are met with the Keyblade and disappear. Dodging more lasers, he heals 
and casts a barrier of air around him, flying back to Ansem to finish this 
once and for all. To Sora’s surprise, he dispels his sword and crosses his 
arms over his body. A large Heartless insignia appears over him, blocking 
him from all attack. The portal over the cage reappears and Sora flies 
into it, finding himself in pitch black room. He is confronted by a horde 
of Shadow Heartless, the only light coming from the Heartless emblem on 
the floor and their eerie glowing eyes. As he destroys the Shadows, a 
long thread appears in the middle of the room, glowing with dark energy. 
Sora strikes at the Room Core, which explodes, sending Sora back to the 
World of Chaos. The Guardian stares down at him, though Ansem doesn’t 
make a move. On the front of the living battleship, the fleshy artillery 
begins to shoot homing beams of energy at him and another portal appears 
above them in front of the Guardian. The artillery wiggle at the expellant 
force as Sora flies nearer to the portal. He is nearly overwhelmed by the 
artillery and as he closes in on the portal, the Guardian slams his great 
claws forward, creating a roaring gust of wind, sending Sora toppling 
away. He is again assaulted by laser-emitting orbs, but he quickly 
dodges in midair and flies back to the artillery. After destroying 
the armaments, he soars into the portal of darkness, finding himself 
in another dark room filled with Darkball Heartless)

Goofy: Sora!

(Sora finds Goofy in the room as well and they take down the Darkballs 
and the following Room Core. They fly back into the World of Chaos, 
where the hugely-fanged Face at the front of the battleship opens its 
gaping maw, staring at them through horrid yellow eyes. They strike at 
the Face, which clenches its teeth, sending bolts of lightning at them. 
It rears its head back as they attack and opens its mouth, sending an 
explosion of energy around them while its eyes glow. Taking the final 
blow, it roars and its head falls limp, the mouth opening. Another portal 
of darkness appears inside its jaw as more artillery appear on the front 
armaments of the battleship. Sora and Goofy fly into the portal, reaching 
another dark room filled with Invisible Heartless)

Donald: Sora!

(The Invisibles spin around, sending orbs of darkness around the room. 
Donald runs toward their voices as the three of the fight off the 
countless horde. Sora destroys the final Room Core and they escape the 
room through the portal. They fly back out of the mouth of the Face, 
which brims with smoke and explodes, leaving a dark blue wound on the 
front of the World of Chaos. The barrier to the cage in the battleship’s 
center collapses and they fly inside the cage, where they find the Main 
Core surrounded by artillery. They attack the Main Core as the artillery 
strike back)

Sora: Give me strength!

(He glows with a golden aura, raising his Keyblade into the air as three 
orbs descend to meet it. He touches them with the Keyblade and they 
gather, forming a three ringed orb. Sora jumps upside down, thrusting 
the Keyblade into the flesh of the cage. He spins around, holding the 
grip of the blade as a bright symbol appears around him. Beams erupt 
from the circles in the symbol and the orb above and the world is 
enveloped in light. The Main Core crackles with energy as the light 
fades. Energy catches its grip and it explodes. The Heartless Emblem 
above Ansem’s body shatters and Ansem slides forward, his silver hair 
trailing behind him. Straightening up, he crosses his hands and his 
pole sword reappears as he glares at Sora, Donald, and Goofy)

Donald (yelling): Let me at him!

Goofy: Come on!

(Sora, Donald, and Goofy combine efforts in their final assault against 
Ansem. As they strike on him with all their might, Ansem raises his arms, 
his mind on one thing)

Ansem: Come...darkness!

(A huge orb of darkness forms in his hands and he shoots it forward into 
the abyss. Pointing his sword at it)

Ansem: Now...you weak-hearted fools...witness real power!

(An immense swirling black hole forms in the orb’s wake. Electricity 
hisses inside it and the void begins shooting meteors of glowing energy 
at the three of them)

Ansem: Now show me what your precious light can do.

(They find themselves drifting towards it uncontrollably, and push 
themselves to fly away from it. Ansem grows tired of this and raises 
his arms, causing the void to explode)

Ansem: Still confused? Then perhaps this will enlighten you!

(Ansem’s sword vanishes and he crosses his arms, sending several small 
translucent orbs into the air. They merge with the Guardian in various 
places, glowing darkly. Laser-emitting orbs return as Sora feels his 
magic draining from him)

Ansem: Welcome the darkness into your heart.

(The battle continues until the World of Chaos begins to burst from the 
inside)

Ansem (faintly): Is this the answer? I can’t be...

(The Guardian roars as it implodes, the veins connecting Ansem to the 
battleship shake violently and he hangs forward, dropping his sword. 
Ansem convulses as the World of Chaos is enveloped by a glowing light. 
Forming a gigantic orb, it explodes, its energy scattering through the 
abyss. Sora, Donald, and Goofy stare down at Ansem, who floats before 
them, twitching. The door to Kingdom Hearts waits behind him)

Ansem: It is futile. The Keyblade alone cannot seal the door to darkness.

(He whirls around, reaching out towards the door, gazing madly as a 
man possessed)

Ansem: Kingdom Hearts! Fill me with the power of darkness...

(His hand trembles as he struggles to recite the words. The great 
door opens, tongues of darkness emanating from beyond its cold white 
stone. Ansem floats higher in the air, his robes billowing out behind him)

Ansem: Supreme darkness...

Sora: You’re wrong. I know now, without a doubt, Kingdom Hearts... is light!

(Without warning, a blinding light bursts from beyond the door, causing 
Ansem to cover his eyes. It penetrates his being, sending his mind reeling)

Ansem: Light...

(He struggles to exist, frozen in place)

Ansem: But... Why...

(Light erupts from his body, sending crystals bursting from his chest. 
His arms are thrown apart as the light consumes everything. Sora, Donald, 
and Goofy fly over to the door and land on the white sand. They race over 
to the door)

Sora: Come on!

(He plants his hands on one of the double doors and begins to push, as 
Goofy and Donald do the same with the other. Goofy peers through them 
and gasps)

Donald: Stop staring and keep pushing!

(Donald looks through it as well, his eyes widening)

Donald: Huh?!

(In the dark realm beyond, Heartless converge by the thousands, pulsing 
with darkness and heading towards the door)

Donald &amp; Goofy: The Heartless!?

Donald: Hurry!

(Sora continues to push, but the enormous door hardly budges)

Sora: I can’t...

(A hand appears from beyond the door)

Riku: Don’t give up!

(Sora looks up in amazement to see Riku)

Riku: Come on, Sora! Together, we can do it!

Sora: Okay!

(He continues pushing the door closed as Riku pulls from the other side. 
The door slowly begins to close as stronger and stronger Heartless appear 
in the dark realm)

Donald: It’s hopeless!

(From the dark realm, the Darkside Heartless are destroyed by an unknown 
figure)

Donald &amp; Goofy: Huh?

(Jumping into view with light shining behind him in the distance, his 
silhouette is unmistakable)

Donald &amp; Goofy: Your Majesty!

(King Mickey takes out a Keyblade with golden blade and silver handle, 
raising it into the air)

Mickey: Now, Sora! Let’s close this door for good!

Donald: Close it, quick!

Sora: But...

Mickey: Don’t worry. There will always be a door to the light.

Goofy: Sora, you can trust King Mickey.

Riku (whirling around towards Mickey): Now! They’re coming!

(Mickey turns to look at them)

Mickey (sincerely): Donald, Goofy, thank you.

(Sora, Donald, and Goofy push with all their might and the doors start 
to close. Just before they do, Riku looks back at Sora)

Riku: Take care of her.

(Sora nods, the penitent face of Riku his final sight before the door 
shuts. Sora leaps back and holds the Keyblade into the air, light 
forming at its tip gathering energy. Mickey swings his Keyblade around, 
releasing magical dust, and raises it into the air. The door begins to 
glow brightly and soon disappears, revealing a long winding pathway 
behind it. Sora, Donald, and Goofy stand still gazing into the void 
left in the door’s wake. Sora’s thoughts drift to Riku and their life 
on the Destiny Islands. When they talked for hours on the dock. When 
they gazed out at the sea from the paopu tree. When they used to play 
fight or race along the beach, laughing at each other. Life was a much 
simpler time then, before the Heartless. When it was just Sora, Riku and... 
Sora feels a presence behind him and turns, seeing Kairi at the edge of 
the world staring around in confusion. Sora runs towards her as fast as 
he can. Donald starts to follow, but Goofy stops him as a light appears 
behind them. They stare off in Sora’s direction as he runs toward the 
only thing on his mind. Kairi takes a few steps backward, her shoes 
digging into the soft sand on the tiny piece of beach she appeared on. 
It seems to be floating off the floating island into the abyss. Kairi 
looks up, her eyes catching Sora)

Sora: Kairi!

(Sora runs up to her)

Kairi: Sora!

(She steps closer and the two worlds shake, separating from each other. 
Kairi shrieks as Sora catches her fall. They stare into each other’s eyes)
 
Sora: Kairi, remember what you said before? I’m always with you, too.

(As the worlds continue to drift apart, they hold hands, leaning forward 
to reach toward one another)

Sora: I’ll come back to you. I promise!

Kairi: I know you will!

(Their hands part and Kairi drifts away from Sora, who reaches out to 
her. She folds her hands together as they continue to stare back, when 
a small point of light floats down into Kairi’s hands. She looks up and 
the sky is filled with tiny points of light, the essence of worlds. They 
float down around the both of them as the Destiny Islands begin to 
reassemble around Kairi. Trees burst through the ground as the wooden 
platforms at the beach reform to the way they used to be. Kairi watches 
as the ocean rolls in. Sora smiles and calls out to Kairi as the world 
barrier forms, finally separating the two of them. Kairi looks down to 
the water as the light around Sora falls back. She looks up suddenly as 
the light bursts into shooting stars which fly into the sky, reclaiming 
their proper places. As the worlds are restored, Kairi’s face forms a 
small smile as she gazes at the beauty around her. Later, the sun and 
the clouds return and the island returns to normal. A soft wind blows 
through the flora and seagulls fly in the air as Kairi walks toward the 
Secret Place. A ray of light shines through the hole in the ceiling, 
illuminating the many drawings on the walls. She walks through the cave, 
touching the rough rocky walls, fondly recalling the memories with her 
friends. She reaches the furthest wall and kneels, seeing a new drawing 
of Sora giving Kairi a paopu fruit. Emotion wells up inside her as an 
image of Sora drawing on the walls appears before her. He stares back at 
her and smiles, before disappearing. She holds out a hand, smiling, and 
starts to cry. She ends her time in the Secret Place by drawing her hand 
giving Sora a paopu fruit. Back in Disney Castle, Chip and Dale call to 
the attention of Daisy and Queen Minnie. They look and see Huey, Dewey, 
and Louie running through the courtyard trailed by a procession of walking 
broomsticks. In the Library of Hollow Bastion, Leon, Yuffie, and Aerith 
converse with each other. The door opens and Aerith looks over seeing 
Cid and Cloud. Aerith moves closer and she bends down to stare into 
Cloud’s eyes. Meanwhile, Pinocchio has become a real boy and he dances 
with glee as Geppetto laughs happily. In Agrabah, Jasmine and Aladdin 
share a passionate kiss as Genie covers his and Abu’s eyes, but peeks 
anyway. On the Destiny Islands, Tidus, Wakka, and Selphie run along the 
beach as Belle, Aurora, Snow White, Cinderella, and Alice return to 
their respective worlds. Meanwhile, Sora, Donald, and Goofy walk down 
a winding dirt road on an unknown world)

Donald: Well, now what do we do?

(Sora walks with his hands behind his head)

Sora: We’ve gotta find Riku and King Mickey.

Goofy: But, uh, where do we start lookin’ for that there door to the light?

(They stop and sigh, bending towards the ground. Sora hears something 
up ahead and looks up, seeing Pluto walk in ahead of them, wagging his tail)

Donald: Pluto?

(Pluto looks over at them)

Goofy: Hey, Pluto. Where have you been?

(They see an envelope in Pluto’s mouth)

Sora: Huh?

Donald: Hey!

Goofy: Gawrsh, that’s the king’s seal!

(Pluto just blinks at them)

Sora: Hey, have you seen King Mickey?

(Sora reaches out a hand but Pluto starts running forward down the road. 
Goofy looks over at Donald, who looks back, happily. Sora runs ahead and 
turns to them)

Sora: Guys, let’s go!

(They race after Pluto, Donald keeping his hat from flying off, and 
laugh together as the road winds ahead of them)

Voice: Remember, Sora. You are the one who will open the door to the light.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


-Special Secret-
“Another side, Another story...”

(With a flash, the dark city awakes. The neon lights paint the town 
as a hooded figure walks through the rainy streets. Raindrops form 
puddles on the pavement. Thunder rumbles and lightning flashes as 
the figure stops in front of a tall skyscraper with enormous video 
screens. Water falls over the man’s hood as he looks down to see 
glowing eyes appear from the ground. The Neoshadow Heartless rise 
up from below, unfazed by the cold rain. They quickly surround the 
man in an immense horde as a silver-haired man gazes down at him from 
above, despite the black blindfold across his eyes. The man whips out 
a Keyblade in his left hand, and then another in his right. He spins 
them in the air and clashes them together, creating sparks. They are 
the Oathkeeper and the Oblivion. Light and Darkness. Lightning flashes 
and the silver-haired man faces the sky with his arms outstretched. The 
clouds part, revealing a meteor shower as a fiery Heartless symbol 
appears on the ground between the hooded man and the Heartless. The 
silver-haired man removes his blindfold as the hooded man speaks)

KINGDOM HEARTS

(On the Destiny Islands, a girl with long hair watches as a meteor 
falls from the sky. She places her hands behind her back)

Special Secret Movie
Another Side, Another Story
[deep dive]


(Sora stands at a crossroads, looking up at the starry sky)

Utter silence

(A bottle with a message in it washes up on shore)

A fragmented tale

A world without you

The eyes will close

(On a dark beach, a hooded figure walks out from a mysterious rock, 
its eyes glowing. It steps forward)

Something so natural

(In an equally dark and empty city, the hooded figure walks down the 
street in pouring rain. A battle begins. He is fighting Heartless using 
two Keyblades)

The memory beyond

(He slices through them like butter. The fighting is vicious, Neoshadow 
Heartless leaping in the air. The figure takes out the three around him 
and tosses a Keyblade through the air to take out the four others hurdling 
above him. He catches the blade as it swoops back down into his hand before 
he lands on the ground. He jumps over the remaining horde at the base of a 
skyscraper and looks skyward)

Something so simple

(A blindfolded man with long silver hair stands atop the roof of the 
skyscraper. The hooded figure leaps onto the building and begins running 
up its side, endless Heartless in pursuit. He slices through a multitude 
of them as he runs up the building, footfalls echoing in his ears)

XIII
“Where’s Sora?”
“We must find him.”

(As he approaches the top of the building, he tosses his Keyblade into 
the air, destroying several Heartless in its path, as the silver-haired 
man leaps off the roof)

12
[Ansem’s other report] “A creation born of ignorance.”

(The man falls past several video screens at the top of the tower and 
grabs the Keyblade)

11
Behind the darkness =/= Door to the light

(Time seems to slow as the two enigmatic characters approach each other 
in their ascent and fall)

X
The secret place
“His voice... It’s left me.”
“This time... I’ll fight.”

(The two men pass each other, glancing at the other’s face)

9
A world between = A forgotten world
The gathering

VIII
The third enemy = NOBODY
“Who is Nobody, you ask? They are the nonexistent ones.”

VII
ENDLESS
“What took you so long, Kairi?”
“Can we do it? Against that?”

(Memories of Sora, Riku, and Kairi flash through their minds. One memory 
of a meeting on the beach between two hooded figures stands out)

HEARTLESS
“We have come for you, my liege.”
“You are the source of all Heartless.”

Metamorphosis
“Sora?”
“Sora... Why?”
“Your Highness! But why?”

The third key

End of the world
“What is this place!?”
“Is this the answer you’ve been looking for?”
“This is the world in its true form.”
“Maybe our journey meant nothing after all.”

3
Paradise
“We’ll go together.”

II

(King Mickey flies down onto the roof of the tower holding his Keyblade. 
He is also in a black hood)

KINGDOM HEARTS

“I went to see him.”

(On the edge of a dark beach, the sun hangs low in the sky, its light dim 
and far away. The hooded man walks up to a second figure, also hooded, who 
is sitting on a rock facing the water. The second man turns to face the first)

“He looks just like you.”

(Sora’s body floats over the ocean, his eyes closed)

“Everything is coming back to me, the true...”
