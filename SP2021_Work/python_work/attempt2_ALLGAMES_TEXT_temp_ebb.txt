Have you heard of the ancient Keyblade War?

Huh? Of course I have.

Long ago, Keyblade wielders waged a war over the ownership of light.

Yeah, the Master's favorite story.

I wonder what they planned on doing with Kingdom Hearts after... making it appear.

Who knows? I don't get why anyone would initiate a war.

So...you know the
?

Who?

They're the ones who started the Keyblade War.

Never heard of 'em. Where'd you hear about that?

Or...they're the ones for whom the war started.

I'm not following you.

You can drop the facade.

Facade?


A prospective Keyblade Master should know this.

If you say so.

The Gazing Eye sees the fate of the World.

The future--it's already been written.

Really? I'm not so sure about that.

Besides, who's to say I can't change it? And maybe light will prevail.

Pretty confident.

But things aren't in your favor.

Perhaps. But unlike darkness, there is more to light than meets the eye. You might be surprised.

Oh, I hope so.

In order to defeat Xehanort, there are allies we must gather, acting now to rouse them from their slumber. We have discussed this before, Sora.

Your Mark of Mastery exam was conducted in the hopes you would acquire the power to wake them. However, the darkness nearly took control of you, and your grasp of your new abilities leaves much to be desired.

Furthermore, Xehanort nearly made you his vessel, and in the process stripped you of most of the power you had gained by then. I suspect you have already noticed this, correct? But first, you must regain all the strength you have lost. Perhaps it is foolish to expect a complete recovery, but it is absolutely vital you perfect one power--the power of waking, which you failed to master during your exam. There's someone who lost his strength and found it again, a true hero to whom you ought to pay a visit.

Perhaps he can point you in the right direction.

Got it.

Master Yen Sid...

You can count on us to take care of Sora!

I would have it no other way. I put Sora in your hands.

And don't forget, we'll keep an eye on you.

Oh, this is gonna be lots of fun!

It's not a vacation!

Let's go!

Count on us!

How're we supposed to get there now?

What? I thought you knew!

Looks like all the old highways are closed. Didn't Master Yen Sid say that Sora should trust the guidance his heart gives?

C'mon, Sora. Which way?

Ummm...

Hey, would you get serious?

Gimme a break, I'm trying. These things take time!

Well, since we've already been before, why don't you try picturing out friends like we're there?

Hmmm...

Well?

Sorry, I got nothin'. What did you expect?




Huh? What's that?

Master Yen Sid always said that, right before we went off on any of our real important adventures.

Really? (to Donald) Ring a bell?

Uh-uh...

Maybe I just imagined it.




I've got it!

It's a gate!

All right! Olympus Coliseum, here we come!

At long last, the time had come. The planets were edging into perfect alignment...and the plan Hades devised eighteen years ago was about to reach fruition. The Fates had predicted this very future--the day he would sieze control of Olympus and rule over all the cosmos. Hades' previous attempts--using Terra, Cloud, and Auron to advance his plans for conquest-- had failed. The hour was not yet right. But now the planets were aligned and nothing could possibly go wrong. A wave of darkness lanced down from their celestial rank, and one by one, Hades freed the Titans from their prison--some of them the same monstrosities that Sora and his friends had already fought and bested before. With both the Titans and his longing for vengeance against Zeus reinvigorated, Hades began his attack on Olympus.

Huh? Uh...

No fanfare?

Un-uh...

Nope, looks like we missed the Coliseum.

Sora, YOU opened the gate!

I was a little off again. Sorry! We'll find him. But we need to go!

Up the mountain?

Yeah.
is the usual direction.

Well, never hurts to have your head in the clouds.

Exactly!

Hey. We're leaving!

I think we might be goin' in circles.

Sora...

Did I make a turn at the wrong rock?

Hey, Hercules! Where are youuu?

All right. I know I dotted my I's, crossed my T's, zeroed the hero. So what gives? Who could possibly be trying to give me a migraine by yodeling that yutz's name?

Really? Hades?

Oh, it's just you. Oy vey.

It's just us? Even for you that's cold.

Don't forget...I can always (yelling) turn up the heat!

Wait. If Hades is here, then where's Herc?

What is everyone's infatuation with that dolt?!

You know what? Never mind. Never mind. I'm cool. I'm good. Because...Wonderboy'll be outta my hair soon enough.

So you're up to no good again!

Of course he is.

You bet!

Whoa, easy--what is this, Sparta? Kind of on a schedule. Don't have time to toss around the old fire and brimstone. The whole cosmos is basically waiting for me to, you know, conquer it!

Poor Hades. He thinks he can actually pull it off this time.

Where are my Titans? Show me your power!

Ahh! Love the breeze.

Ahh. That sent 'em sailing.

Sailing right to where I left...

Eh, no biggie.

Nice work, boys! So, back to the whole cosmic coup thing?

Ugh. Really? Are you kidding? Geez Louise. Seriously, when it rains, it pours. Okay, who's the new pest?

Hey, now, that ain't no way to say hello, 'specially to your old friends.

Oh, perfect. Now I gotta put up with you two. Funny, I don't remember you doing me any memorable favors. So, you can keep your Heartless this time. I'm going back to my original plan. All right? So...toodle-oo! Exit's thataway.

Hey, it was great seein' ya! (singing) Happy traaails!

We are not here for you. I have my own business to attend to. All I need to know is if there is a distinctive...black box somewhere in this world?

Black box, huh?

Hmm... Black box, black box, black box... Wait. Don't tell me... You're after the one Zeus hid on earth?

Possibly. If I were, where might it be?

See? Found him.

Yeah, guess this counts!

Get me down!

Just a second!

You guys are here! Sora, Donald, Goofy! You literally dropped in. Gotta say, I'm impressed.

Thanks!

Liked the catch.

Yeah, thanks Herc. But...what's going on?

Take a guess. Starts with an H.

Ah, I get the picture. Actually, we bumped into the H-ster on the way here.

Uh-huh.

He said somethin' about conquerin' the whole cosmos.

All of it, huh? Nice of him to show a little self-restraint. Well, whatever he's planning, I'll send him running back across the Styx.

That's our Herc!

So Sora, is there a reason you guys are visiting? I'm guessing it's not just for the cheese and olives.

Oh yeah!

It sounds like somebody forgot.

That's Sora.

I just...took my time remembering. Herc, I came here so I could ask you something.

Ask ME?

Yeah. Do you remember the last time we were together? You were feeling down and out. How'd you get your strength back--when you jumped in and saved Meg?

Hmm...that's tough. All I know is that she was in trouble. Suddenly, I wanted to save her with all my heart, but...it's not like I could tell you how.

Oh, man.

What's wrong?

All my strength is gone from me too. That's why I need you--because I was hoping you might have a solution, or something.

I'm sorry, Sora.

Heartless!

Let's talk later!

Right...once we've dealt with these guys.

Hercules!

You're okay!

Meg!

Boy, that didn't look so fun.

No, not with the Heartless involved. We're just lucky our friends showed up.

Well, whaddaya know? Sora, Donald, Goofy, guess I owe you a big thank you.

Meg, you need to stay someplace safe. We'll search the city and make sure everyone manages to get clear of the fire.

Be careful, Wonderboy.

I will.

So, you guys in?

Of course we're in!

We're heroes!

Mm-hmm!

Break a leg then...heroes.

Phil, you should go with Meg.

You gotta keep her safe.

Heeelp!

Is anyone theeere?

Hey! I hear a voice!

From which way?

Over that way.

Help meee!

Oh no! There's a little girl caught in the fire!

Let's go!

Wait. Running's too slow!

Then what's the other choice?

Get on that.

Is it safe?

Hope so.

Like this?

That's good. Now hold on tight!

Wh-- Wha-- Whoooa! Herc, m-maybe we should... I don't think this is a good idea!

Oh no! Not agaaaaaain!

Thank you for saving me.

Yeah, no prob.

We better check and see if anyone else needs us.

Yep.

Well, if it isn't Sora and the King's pawns.

Maleficent! Pete!

Are you the reason the Heartless are here?

Certainly not.

Say, Maleficent, I dunno about his sidekicks, but Kid Keyblader here looks way punier than the last time we saw him.

I say we finish him off while we still can.

Waste no time with the boy. He's inconsequential. We have a far more pressing matter to attend to.

Oh! We gots to find that black box.

Be silent, you fool!

As for you three: we shall meet again...when I have time for such trifles.

Yeah, and youse better get your act together before then. Later, twerps!

Wait!

Sora?

It's fine. I can take it.

Gawrsh, it sure don't sound like it. Did Pete sayin' mean things bother ya?

It's fine! I can take it.

You're gonna get stronger!

We know ya! You CAN take it!

Don't say that!

I just said what he said.

He can take it!

Ouch!

Now what are we gonna do?

Fellas! I just got a crazy idea!

The shield!

Ready?

Here goes!

The building!

Gawrsh, I hope they've got insurance.

If there's anybody else stuck out here, we'd better find 'em fast.

Someone, heeelp!

Where did all these monsters come from? Hercules, where are youuu?!

Look!

Oh no!

Help is on the way!

We'll put these hotheads out!

Hang on up there!

Huh? Who are you three? Where is Hercules?

Hey, we're heroes too!

Thank you. You're so kind. Keep training and one day you'll be great heroes just like Hercules.


? Is it that obvious?

Just for you.

Hey!

I think we all have a ways to go. But we'll get there together!

Yeah, we will.

Herc!

Sora!

Nooo!

More Heartless!

You take them. We need to save these people!

Herc, can you hold the building?

No problem!

Donald. Goofy. We gotta do this quick!

Get the people out!

Okay!

Are you guys all right? You need to get to safety.

Hurry, hurry!

Go! Quickly!

Hercules!

You scared us!

It's nothing. That's what these are for.

Oh, wow! Very nice, full marks.

Go away!

No Organization!

You're Xigbar!

All this altruism is giving me the warm and fuzzies. So then, does having a heart of light come with an extremely good insurance policy?

Just say what you mean.

Oh, but I did though. No good will ever come from putting other people first.

I was able to save Meg's life because I was ready to risk my own.

Because you've got friends in high places, you mean. Tricks like that don't fly for your average joe.

What do you know? You weren't even there! If you were, you'd admire Herc's courage.

I don't admire one guy leaping into danger if it means someone else might have to jump in to save him. You're all just lining up to lose out. Dooming others to take the fall with ya. Oh, and you can spare me the usual party line. Yes, hearts are powerful when they're connected. But if you put too much of that power in one place, some of those hearts might end up breaking.

Still, Sora, that doesn't mean you should change. Accept the power you're given. Find the hearts joined to yours.

Why would I ever take advice from YOU?

As if! You don't have any choice but to follow this sweet little trail of bread crumbs. And at the end, you'll finally realize what destiny has in store for you. In fact, your reward might be right around the corner. You're so close!

Hearts breaking? Whose hearts?

Sora, don't let him bother you. He's just trying to get under your skin 'cause he thinks he can. But we'll prove him wrong. We'll show him that our sacrifices haven't been for nothing.

You're right.

Mm-hmm! Besides, we're already proof enough!

We're a team! When we're together, we can do anything!

Yeah!

...What reward?

Nice job, Wonderboy.

We checked the whole area. It looks like everyone's safe.

That's great. We did what we could.

You heroes have been busy little bees.

Oh... Look. More trouble!

It's Hades.

Herc! Let's go!

Right!

This sure does feel awfully familiar...

Yeah, just like before.

Guys, this is getting worse by the minute. I hope I'm wrong, but my family may need me.

Sora, I'm gonna fly ahead.

You've been a big help, but...leave the rest to me.

Family?

Yeah. Dad's king of the gods.

Whaaat?!

His father is a god? But doesn't that mean Herc is a god too?

I think it does.

No wonder he's so strong!

Then he'll be okay.

Won't he?

No. Organization XIII's here. He'll need our help.

Good point. We gotta go!

'Cause heroes never quit.

Hmm...that's tough. All I know is that she was in trouble. Suddenly, I wanted to save her with all my heart...

We fight with all our heart.

C'mon!

Titan!

Yes! That's one down!

They're not so tough by themselves.

That one was dumb as a rock.

Okay! What's next?

Whoa! Is this...Olympus?

Gawrsh, it's amazing!

The fanfare?

Nope!

I swear to you, Hades, when I get out of th--

No, I'm the one giving orders now, bolt boy.

Don't get too comfortable, Hades!

Huh?

We're gonna stop you!

What?!

Get them!

Sora, Donald, Goofy!

It's on!

Yeah!

Just one Titan left!

Uh-oh! Now it's all four of them.

So what? There are four of us too.

Actually, I think I can make it five.

Nooo!

Thank you, my boy.

Yeah!

Hah! Now, watch your old man work!

We did it!

I can't believe it! I put eighteen years into that plan and you've blippin' ruined it! I REALLY don't like you.

Just give it up already! You'll never beat Herc, no matter how many times you try.

Yeah, stay in the Underworld where ya belong.

Go have the time of your afterlife.

Enough already! I did not come this far to be ridiculed by Zeusy high and mighty, his little sunspot, and a trio of clowns!

You know what? I'll just go ahead and destroy you!

Hades.

The exit is that way.

Oy vey... Geez Louise...

Hold on. I almost forgot.

That one's for trying to wreck Thebes.

You'll pay for this! I have a very, VERY long memory!

I can still dunk your little Nut-Meg in a river of de--

Are you sure you want to leave all this behind?

Isn't Olympus your home?

And your family.

I can see my family anytime I want. If I stayed, I'd have to be apart from the person I love most... And that life would be empty.

I finally know where I belong.

Hercules...

Sora, we never got back to your question. Can I help?

Mmm, it's okay. I think I'm meant to figure it out for myself. I'll find my strength the way you found yours. Something to fight for...with all my heart. I guess you DID have the answer.

Well, you've got heart, Sora. Just keep at it and I know you'll be stronger than ever.

Yeah, I might even end up stronger than YOU are.

There he goes again.

Are you sure this box with the Book of Prophecies is for reals? I think that dingbat in black was pulling your leg.

Be quiet and dig, you imbecile. I must find that Book of Prophecies and make it my own. His was the only clue we have. We cannot afford to dismiss it without a thorough investigation.

I'm just sayin', a shot in the dark ain't gonna get us any closer to--

Whoa!

What is it? Have you found something? Show it to me at once, fool.

Yes sir-eesy, this has gotta be that Pandora's Box Hades mentioned.

Leave it.

What? After all that diggin'?

That is not the box which I desire. We are finished with this world. Come.

Awwwwww...

May your hear--

What's wrong, Riku? Are you tired? Do you need a break? We can stop.

No, just... I've been here. I should know this place. But that all seems like another life.

Well, gee. Think of all you've seen! All the feelings you've felt. Why, you've done years of growin' in almost no time at all.

I remember my first time here. I was so scared. But now, my doubts and fears are gone. If anything, I feel exhilarated. And it's not because there's darkness in me--I know too well what that rush is like. This is different. And it's not adrenaline either. I know Aqua needs us...but I'm ready. I'm in control now. Maybe it's because you're with me this time.

It's not me. I think it's because you've finally found inside you that special strength to protect what matters.

What?

Sometimes you care so much for somebody that other feelings disappear. And then, there's no room for fear or doubt.

Is that it?


... It reminds me of a promise I made.

To who?

Just someone I once met. Can't tell.

Sounds like a good memory.

Yeah... While we're reminicing--Mickey, does any of this look familiar?

Sort of, but the realm of darkness has changed since I was here with Aqua.

Yeah, it's different from what I remember.

Usually, I'd just follow my heart, and Aqua would show me the way. But the closer I get, the hazier our connection feels.

You mean...

Maybe, but we can't give up hope.

Yeah.

This beach...

It's gone...

Huh?

I'm positive Aqua was here. But now...her trail's gone dim.

I've been here, too. With Sora.

Really?

This is where we found our way back to the realm of light. Hey, maybe Aqua did, too!

Aqua...has fallen into an even darker abyss--somewhere I can't see her. And I don't think we're equipped to dive any deeper than we already are.

So then...

Oh no!

What?!

Riku...be careful. Even the least threatening Heartless are stronger in this realm.

I got it.

It's not over. Be careful!

Oh no!

Riku!

Didn't expect to see you again.

What...?

Why did you even come here?

Because somebody needs me.

Do you want some help?

Who are you?

Me? I'm...

Riku... Wake up... Riku.

Are you okay?

Where'd the Heartless go?

I got more than half of 'em, and the rest vanished. But, they spit you out first.

Thanks. I owe ya.

I know ya feel invincible, but we're not.

Are YOU all right, Mickey?

Yeah, thanks to the new gear. But...your Keyblade...

Oh.

The Heartless here are stronger than what we expected. I guess we probably should've powered up our Keyblades before we came in here, huh? I think we need to go back to Master Yen Sid's tower so we can regroup.

But Aqua's...still down here, alone. Facing enemies like that.

I know...

What if she's feeling as scared and alone...as I felt the first time I came here? How long are we supposed to keep her waiting in this awful place?

But Aqua... She's like Sora.

Whaaat!?

No no no... STRONG like Sora!

Okay... Good. Then I guess she's gonna be all right. Sora could fall into any darkness and swim his way out.

Besides, we won't be long.

Right.

Huh?

Can't use THIS Keyblade anymore. Might as well leave it here... for the other me.

Wha...?

I see... You could not regain your strength.

Aw, no biggie. I still learned a lot.

Regardless, Sora, you will need the power of waking.

It can't be gone forever. Maybe something'll trigger it real soon.

Like, what exactly?

I know! How about a bonk on the head?

Hey!

Perhaps it could be something that is as simple as that.

Wait, YOU think so too?

Whenever you are in need, magic happens. That is your greatest strength, Sora.

You make it sound like an accident.

Huh?

We're back, Master!

Whoa!

Oh, wow. You guys are all here!

We were here before, but you didn't wait.

Your Majesty!

Hey there, fellas. So, what've you three been up to?

We were visi--

We went to Olympus to visit Hercules!

And to figure out how to get all of Sora's lost powers back.

But...it was a big disappointment.

Oh. What a shame. But, honestly...

We didn't fare any better.

Did ya manage to figure out where Aqua is? 'Cause Master Yen Sid said that's why you fellas left.

Even a hint?

Come on. Can I finally say something?

We know Master Aqua made it as far as the beach that Sora and I once visited, but that's where her trail ends.

Meaning...?

All traces of her vanish into the great abyss...beneath the realm of darkness.

She's gone?

No. Sora was dragged into the abyss during his exam. And I went in after him. So, I think if we find someone who was really close to Aqua, and they make the dive, they could reach her down there.

I'm not sure who's even left to ask. Ventus is hidden...and Aqua's the only one who knows where. Plus, nobody's seen Terra in ages. Aqua was the last.

So Aqua--she's gonna be the key to finding all three.

Yes. Their teacher, Master Eraqus, would have been another possibility, had Xehanort not mercilessly struck him down.

I'll save her.

Huh?

You can't!

But Sora, that's gonna be super hard since you don't have the power of waking.

Huh? Sorry... I have no idea why that just popped out.

Well, it was pretty convincing.

Yeah, better not let us down.

Sora, you must focus on regaining your lost power of waking. Mickey and Riku, I recall that Master Aqua journeyed to many worlds, and connected with others who could be the link we need.

Good plan, sir. Riku and I will retrace her steps and see if we can find any sort of clues, but first...

Hmm?

We got hit pretty hard in the realm of darkness. My Keyblade was damaged, and the Heartless broke Riku's clean in half. So, we're gonna need to get replacements before we can continue.

In that case, rendezvous with Kairi and Lea. They are continuing their training under the tutelage of the wizard Merlin.

Yes, sir.

Also, I would like you to deliver these for me.

Are they...

Yes, they are the same as the ones I gave you. Special vestments to shield Kairi and Lea from the darkness.

We got 'em.

What? No fair! What about my outfit, Master?

Sora, don't bug him like that. It's inconsiderate.

Settle down. I have new clothes for you, too, Sora.

Yeah?

A gift from the good fairies.

I knew you'd come through for me. Thanks!

Those are no ordinary garments, Sora.

Like before, they have very special powers, so it took extra time to prepare them. In addition, there is a gift from Chip and Dale inside.

Cool. Okay!

Happy now?

Yup!

Now, you are all ready to proceed.

Hey, wait! Don't forget about me!

Jiminy!

Every journey worth goin' on needs a cricket to keep track of it. And I can't let ya start this one without ol' Jiminy Cricket by your side.

The whole team's back!

Yeah.

Yeah!

Good. Now, to mark the beginning of a new journey, I wish for you to have this, Sora.

Okay?

That is a Heartbinder. Think of it as a good luck charm made just for you. You have a gift, Sora, for connecting with others, and this makes that gift stronger.

It's time to go!

May your heart be your guiding key.

See?

Okay, where to?

Ummmmmm...

Oh, come on. Would you get serious?

Gimme a break, okay? I told you. These things take time.

Gawrsh, is it just me, or is this turning into a routine?

Huh? What?

It's comin' from you, Sora!

Huh?

What's this?

Got me! Make it stop.

But, I don't know how. Maybe...this.

Hurray! He picked up.

Huh? Dale?

Hey, Chipper, I finally got him! Hurry up, Chip!

Well, it's about time.

Chip?

Ya gotta answer the phone, Sora, or we can't give ya updates. We got lots and LOTS of important stuff we want to tell ya!

That's why we asked Master Yen Sid to make sure you got this Gummiphone we made ya. So we'd be able to stay in touch with you at all times.

AND it takes pictures.

Oh! You finally finished it. Say, with this Gummiphone, we can talk to each other across worlds. In fact, I might even try writing my journal on it.

Wow! Sounds like it's pretty handy, guys. So, what's so important?

This! Back when you and Riku quested through the Sleeping Worlds, Riku recovered some secret research data that Ansem the Wise hid inside you.

Ansem's Code!

Mm-hmm. We've been workin' our tails off tryin' to crack it and see what it says.

The data has been encrypted, so we've only deciphered some of it.

Huh?

Oh... I guess we haven't spoken since the castle. I'm Ienzo. Aeleus is here too.

Aeleus, whatever's between you and Roxas, it's in the past.

Sora, the reason we're here is because you and your friends defeated our Nobodies, thereby
us. We cast off our hearts by choice, make no mistake, but we didn't know that Xemnas--or rather, Xehanort--was deceiving us.

Huh? Xemnas?

Aw, he's with them!

Not anymore. Xemnas and Xehanort have no hold over us now. We're just students of the heart, exactly the same as we were before all of this began.

Yeah, right.

Hmm... But ya know, now that I think about it, Axel's on our side now.

We have friends we want to bring back to this world, just the same as you. To do that, we have to work together. In that spirit, Sora...

...we found some intriguing data in the bit of code we deciphered.

Is it about me?

Yes. In order to piece your memories back together, our teacher, Ansem the Wise, look a close look at your heart. And what he found...

...is that your heart doesn't belong just to you.

It doesn't?

Gawrsh, you don't seem surprised.

Yeah. Honestly, I suspected as much. There's another heart inside mine. I think it's Roxas's. Just like Naminé is still inside Kairi's.

Interesting... Well, no one knows your heart better than you.

To be honest, we still have a plethora of questions on our side, but...the idea has merit. It's incredible enough that you and your Nobody are able to coexist. If you share a heart...no wonder someone as remarkable as you caught Ansem the Wise's eye. We'll keep investigating based on your hypothesis. I'll be in touch.

Okeydokey, we'll give you fellas a ring if there's anything else. Remember, me and Chip, the guys at Radiant Garden, and King Mickey and everybody are never far away.

And Jiminy, would ya do us a favor? Teach Sora how to use the Gummiphone.

Leave it to me.

I have to find Roxas and save him. The others are following Aqua's heart, so I'll follow Roxas's heart!

Trust the guidance that your heart gives ya, Sora. That's what Master Yen Sid said.

Where to?

Oh, that's easy.

Gawrsh, we forgot to fill Master Yen Sid in on what happened. Should we go back?

Typical Sora.

Hmm... You mean about Maleficent and Xigbar? No, the others have already got enough on their plates as it is. Why go stressing them out? The three of us know how to handle a couple of old adversaries, right?

Yeah, I guess...

But doesn't that thing Pete said bother ya?

The black box?

Come on, we're talking about Pete. That means it's probably no big deal.

I don't know...

Oh, cool. The trams are still here!

Sora, it hasn't been THAT long.

Feels like it.

Maybe you're feeling what Roxas feels 'cause he misses home.

Mm-hmm. Actually, I ran into Roxas in the Sleeping Worlds. It was like...seeing into his heart for the first time.

And he was in the datascape, too.

Uh-huh. It was a test to see if your data version was ready to face the hurt that ya carry inside.

Was I ready? I do know hurt. When I lost Riku and Kairi, and later when I lost the Keyblade, and you guys had to go on without me like that... Having no one to turn to was the worst kind of hurt. But that just shows how much you mean to me. Carrying around a little hurt can't be all that bad. Hurting is part of caring.

He sounds like Data-Sora did.

Of course. Any Sora's still Sora.

So wait... If Roxas feels something, then we're in the right place. Roxas, I'm gonna find you!

Do you seek our liege?

Huh?

What is it?

Nobodies!

Hmm... What was that voice? I know I heard it.

I didn't hear it.

You sure it wasn't the wind? Or somethin' else?

I'm pretty sure...

Where'd they come from?!

Get the ice cream later!

What? Hold up!

See? Voices.

...New ones?

What? Hayner? Pence! Olette!

What is THAT?!

Heeey! Sora!

Hello, good-bye.

Go! We got this.

Nice fightin'! Thanks, Sora.

Hayner, Pence, Olette. It's been ages!

What? It hasn't been THAT long.

Ya see?

Donald! Goofy! How are ya?

We're good.

Howdy there, Olette.

So does this mean that weird stuff's going down again?

You kidding, Pence? When have we ever seen a tornado of shadowy blobs before? It's not
This is underprecedented.

Hmm, I guess it is. The creatures from the last time were bright white. These things must be new. Man, I can't wait to get to sleuthin'.

We're already done with the school project, silly. (to Sora) Whatever's going on, you wouldn't be here unless you had a good reason.

Which is?

Well, actually, we're looking for Roxas.

Roxas?

That's funny... I don't know any Roxas, but the name sounds familiar.

Maybe we bumped into him somewhere.

Uh, that's one way to put it.

Actually, he mighta been friends with another version of ya.

This photograph...

Yeah. We've got the same one.

Oh yeah! The other Twilight Town!

It's like one of those
puzzles...except really easy. I guess in that town, we're friends with this
person.

Sora, let us help you track Roxas down.

Really?

Sure, he seems like a pretty cool guy.

Yeah. He is.

Great. Then let's all go ask around town. If alternate-us knew Roxas, then maybe alternate-other folks did too.

Mm-hmm. Sora, you three should go to the place in the photo. It's the old mansion. The three of us'll cover places in town.

Thanks. Oh yeah! I got this phone thingy that takes pictures.

Want to snap a photo while we're all here?

Sure!

That's a great idea!

Wait, who's taking it?

Aww! Why do I have to do it?

Hey, tough luck. You drew the short straw.

It's okay. I'm sittin' outta the photo with ya, Donald.

Then YOU take the photograph!

Everybody smile. A-hyuck!

Wow, that came out great!

Oh! A lucky emblem.

Lucky emblem?

Oh yeah, they are HUGE right now. Supposedly, these things are hidden all over town. And if you get a picture of them, they'll bring you good luck.

Cool! Wait. Look, guys! Is that...

You're right! I see it too.

Is it the King?

I knew it.

Good luck, because they're not all this easy to find.

Okay, we better start asking around. You start by checking the old mansion. We'll catch up.

Got it.

What's that?

Heartless!

What do ya think they're up to?

Look! On that branch. The Heartless have him surrounded!

Oh no!

Let's help!

Yeah!

Well, take care.

Wh-what is--

Are you okay?

Lookie! That little feller's parked on your head.

Huuuh?

Would you cut that--

Sora, you've been hijacked.

Ya know, maybe he wants you to pick up the fruit for him.

Okay, that's fine. But I can do it by myself.

I just need to collect the fruit?

Right, then.

So, what're you gonna do with all this, anyway?

Huh?

Well, okay. You be careful going home.

Bye-bye!

See ya 'round!

Whaddaya think, guys? This place is even creepier than I remember.

Well, they do say that this mansion is haunted.

Hey, there.

Thanks for the heart attack!

Oh, what? Did I scare you?

Not a chance!

Our bad.

So how did it go? Did ya get any leads?

Nope, 'fraid not. The asking around thing was a total bust.

Yup. This old mansion is our last hope.

You guys ready?

Another Twilight Town awaits!

Yeah.

Here we go!

The password was...uh...
right?

Okay, I'm in. Let's get that transporter working...

Uhhh...

Oh, man. The transporter's been protected.

Protected from what?

I guess from us? We can't use it to get to the other Twilight Town.

Why not? It worked before! We sent Sora there!

Well that was then, and this is now.

And there's no other way?

None that I know.

Great.

Hello, Sora. You wouldn't happen to be in front of a computer?

Huh? Well...yeah. But how'd you know that?

I was tinkering with Ansem's computer--you know, to decrypt the Code that was left in it? And I noticed that someone had logged in from another terminal. I figured it might be you.

Oh! Yeah, the log terminal.

You don't know what he said.

Oh, and what, you do?

I know I haven't got a clue. A-hyuck!

Then, uhh...who was it that logged in?

Oh, hi there. This is Pence.

I'm the one who logged into the computer.

Good. As long as it's a user that we know we can trust.

Yup. But, I'm kind of stuck here.

One of the programs is protected, so...I can't run it.

Which program?

The transporter to the other Twilight Town!

It's the only way to find Roxas. You gotta help us.

Another Twilight Town? And a
? Okay... A virtual town inside the computer, made of data.

A datascape! Fellas...

Mm-hmm, we've seen one. That's what we used once to investigate Jiminy's journal.

Maybe I can do something. Pence, let's get a network set up. My address here is...

Okay, sharing is enabled.

Huh? Were you able to fix it?

Now that our two computers have been successfully networked together, I can take control of the terminal there and change the privileges...

And Roxas?

Yes. For the virtual world to be completely realized, Ansem the Wise would've included Roxas's full data in the construction. Meaning, somewhere on your machine there's a log of that data that--

Uhh...basically, we can decipher Ansem's Code more quickly, AND we can analyze the virtual Twilight Town while we're at it.

Okay. Great! I can't computer so...do that.

Glad you're following along. Don't worry, we'll handle it. Chip and Dale will be helping me out here on this end. I'll call you back as soon as we know anything more.

Thanks.

Oh, before I forget--a bit of troubling news. It's about one of the Organization's former members. You knew him as Vexen--but to us he was Ansem's apprentice Even. He was recompleted like the rest of us, but hadn't regained consciousness yet. Then, sometime after Lea left, Even vanished. Aeleus and Dilan--the two you know as Lexaeus and Xaldin--they went out looking for him, but...he's just gone. And I'm starting to worry.

You think he's on THEIR side?

I think it's a real possibility. He's a devious researcher. You should be careful.

All right. Thanks.

Oh no! We got work! I totally forgot.

Really? But what about all this?

Hey, both are important. We're gonna need some cash to go to the beach. Also, don't forget the pretzels. Gotta buy four now.

Ohh. I get it.

He's thinking ahead.

Later, Sora!

Yeah. See ya, Hayner!

Bye, Donald! Goofy!

Good-bye!

Oh, and since I'm manning the computer here, you guys're in charge of earning my share.

No pretzel for Pence.

Hey!

So, you think you can bring Roxas back?

Ansem!

Xemnas!

Roxas should never have existed in the first place. What you seek is impossible.

Roxas does exist. His heart's inside my heart.

And in the unlikely event you did manage to separate the two, where is it you think you can put his heart?

Well...Roxas used to live in the other Twilight Town, right? So, I'm just gonna put him back there.

Do you even realize what you are saying? The other Twilight Town is just data.

A heart can live anywhere. Even inside data. There are hearts all around us.

Ansem and Xemnas used to be part of the same person, right? But look. Now, they exist separately just fine. If they can do it, then I don't see any reason why you and Roxas can't find a way.

Oh...yeah!

Yeah! You tell 'em, Captain Goofy!

In that case, by all means.

Nothing would please us more than Roxas's return, of course.

You wish. He'll never answer to you again.

Still so blind. A Nobody is what's left behind when one gives his heart to darkness. There is only one way to bring Roxas back, which is for you to give your heart up as well. Sora, have you finally decided to call upon the darkness?

What?

Go on then. The shadows are never out of reach.

Now, set your heart free.

Wait!

Sora!

It's not darkness. Not if it helps him!

Herc said... He said,
Okay. Then all my heart it is. I'm getting Roxas out.

Are you with me, Donald? Goofy?

You betcha!

I don't know what Ansem and Xemnas want, but I think we'd better tell the others to watch out.

Yeah.

Okay then. Let's head back to town.

Well, bless my bagpipes! It was YOU laddies who rescued my chef.

It's Uncle Scrooge!

Huh? Wait... Didn't he sell ice cream in Hollow Bastion?

That's right. But Uncle Scrooge here's what you might call a world traveler.

Cool.

How are ya, Uncle Scrooge?

Oh! Hello, Sora! You're lookin' hale and hearty. I heard ye were on another grand adventure with these two. I hope Donald isn't making a menace of himself.

Aw. Why did you have to say that?

So, Uncle Scrooge, what's that you were sayin' about a chef?

Och! Right, right. The chef of me bistro here wanted to show ye his appreciation, so he baked this for ye.

What is it?

Wow, cake!

The whole cake? It's for us?

Aye, settle down... The chef wants ye to know it's not a cake, but a 'tarte aux fruits'.

He does?

Why keep it under my hat? May I introduce...

Little Chef.

Oh! It's you!

Uncle Scrooge, you opened a bistro in Twilight Town?

Aye. It all started a little while ago, when I was enjoying one of the best meals of my life.

And when I asked to speak to the chef, I met this wee genius.

As it turns out, he wanted to expand his culinary horizons. So, I thought: that's an opportunity. And I financed the whole operation.

Ooh, I think he wants to cook some more for ye.

Fetch some ingredients. Especially anything unusual.

That'll be fun! Kinda like a scavenger hunt.

An' the more the better. The mark of a truly great chef is creating masterpieces out of anything. Ye can start right here in town.

We'll do anything to try more of Little Chef's food.

Yeah!

That tarte sure did look scrumptiously delicious.

Okay! The ingredient hunt is on.

Hey! Guys!

Hayner! Olette!

Hey, boss. Done with the posters.

Aye, good work, kids.

You guys work for Uncle Scrooge here at the bistro?

Umm... Do we?

He gave us a short job putting up these special posters.

Mr. McDuck's hosting an open-air film festival in the courtyard. Cool, huh?

Oh. Sora... Hold your phone up to the poster.

'Kaaay...

There, you've just downloaded a promo game for the film. You can try it later.

You did all this, Uncle Scrooge?

Of course, laddie. Provide a bit of entertainment, and then give folks a nice, cozy place to relax.

Like me bistro here. They'll all be happy, an' hungry, an' eager to spend their money.

Uncle Scrooge...

Gawrsh, he sure is canny. I always wondered how he keeps customers comin' into his businesses over and over.

Oh, yeah, I'm no business guy, but I sure wouldn't wanna be one of Uncle Scrooge's competitors.

Seriously.

Oh! Right. I need to warn you guys.

Why?

Well, those creepy-crawly things might come back for more, so stay on your toes.

Sure. But don't we have you guys to take care of 'em for us?

You have to leave AGAIN?

Mm-hmm.

It's our job.

But we'll definitely be back.

When ya gonna slow down?

Sorry. Just do me a favor...

Well, what is it? Don't make it too tough.

I know how Roxas feels. To be lost. But Donald and Goofy...Kairi... brought me back by wishing with all their hearts.

So...I was hoping the three of you would do the same, and wish for Roxas.

What? That's it? (chuckles) That's no favor. We'll all wish. I'm wishin'.

Yeah! Me and Pence too.

Thanks.

Aren't you making it a little too obvious?

We were instructed to guide him.

Yes...just look at them. They wouldn't get far if we did not spell it out.

Fair enough. But let's not forget how many times Sora still managed to rain on our parade.

If he wavers from the path we lay, we destroy him.

But in that case...we'll have to find ourselves another vessel.

That is why we never have just one iron in the fire.

Is the food ready yet?

Huh? He hasn't started?

Whoa! Hold on! Hey!

Oh no!

Would you--

You're gonna make ME cook?

I'm sorry I left without saying good-bye. Did Master Yen Sid tell you? I'm training to become a Keyblade wielder like you. That's right. No more waiting for you to come back from your adventures. I want to get out there and do my part to help. Merlin has used his magic to bring us to a place where time doesn't matter. We can take as long as we need to complete our training. He's an amazing wizard. Oh, and by
I mean me and Lea. He's really sorry for all the trouble he caused. I told him it's fine, but he won't stop apologizing. I'll admit I was a little scared of him at first, but I've gotten to know him better. All he ever wanted was to help his friend. Honestly, it's hard not to like him. Every now and then, I catch him staring at me. When I ask what's wrong, he says,
Sora, I think it may have something to do with you. Your journey is all about helping people: some that you've never met before, and some like Lea that you have. They're all counting on you. It won't be easy, but I hope you'll remain the happy and cheerful Sora I know. There's no heart your smile can't reach.

What's wrong?

Huh? Nothin', sorry.

Lea.

What? I am.

A letter?

Yup.

To Sora?

Mmm, technically yes. But I won't send it. It's more for me.

Ask Merlin. He'll deliver it for you.

Yeah, but it's okay. I just like talking to Sora, even if it's on paper.

Ohh... Okay.

Oh!

Here.

Ice cream? Really?

Yeah, I asked Merlin to pick these up.

Ya know, we did both summon Keyblades. Gotta celebrate.

You're sweet, Lea.

Naw...

What?

N-nothing, I just...

You're trying to remember what you forgot?

Well, I, uh... Yeah... Yeah.

So tomorrow--you and me in the ring. You ready?

'Course.

Don't hold back, Lea. Promise?

Huh? Are you okay? Lea!

Yeah... Sorry...

You're crying. What's wrong?

Something in my eyes.

Lea...

I'm...gonna go. Sorry.

'Kay, but stop apologizing.

Fine...on one condition.

What?

Call me Axel from now on. Got it memorized?

Yeah. Okay, Axel.

So, this is the place.

Where Aqua fell into the realm of darkness after she dove in to save Terra.

Yeah, she said he was acting strange.

Strange how, exactly?

She sensed darkness in him, and they ended up getting into a big fight.

Right. And in the aftermath, the two of them disappeared. Around the same time, the guards found a stranger with white hair lying unconscious here in the square--a man calling himself


Ansem the Wise took the stranger in, but that was a mistake. Xehanort betrayed his master, stole his research, and along with his fellow apprentices, separated his heart from his body. Xehanort's heart took his master's name,
and traveled to the past to give his younger self instructions. He even briefly had control of you. His empty body stayed in the present, took the name Xemnas, and founded Organization XIII. Their goal was to prepare thirteen vessels for Xehanort's heart.

Until we put an end to the Organization. But all the while Young Xehanort had been visiting the future to choose thirteen vessels of his own-- hearts with strong enough ties to him to begin a new Organization, the REAL Organization XIII. And now they're looking for a fight with us. But what happened to Terra? I thought you said that Aqua saved him.

Yep, she did. The problem is we didn't notice. You remember the end of the Mark of Mastery exam, when Master Xehanort made his grand return? That's the Xehanort I remember. He was already a pretty old man then. But how do you explain Ansem and Xemnas, his Heartless and his Nobody? Isn't it strange how young they look? Why aren't THEY old men? It's because Xehanort was using a different body when the split happened. That face from the portrait I mentioned--it wasn't just some stranger that Ansem the Wise took under his wing. It was the young man whose body Master Xehanort possessed.

No way! That was Terra? Master Xehanort was using Terra?

Yep. Master Xehanort told us
belonged to him. He was talking about Terra. Turns out, Aqua saved more than just her friend that day.

Okay, but Master Xehanort is an old man again now. Where did Terra's body go?

Hmm... (gasp) It's cause Master Xehanort's collecting vessels! He claimed to have two of our seven lights. We got Sora back, but Terra must still be on Xehanort's side.

He's with Organization XIII? We should warn Sora.

Yep! And Merlin, too.

Yeah.

I was watching that.

Ah, sorry. But this is no time for television, Rex.

Gotta say, that Gigas is pretty impressive.

Really?

I like Yozora most.

Woody? What gives?

Shh!

Are they back?

Shhhhhh!

All right, guys. Today we teach those masked intruders who's boss. Is everybody in position?

Wait. Hold on! I don't think I'm emotionally prepared!

Would you calm down? Don't worry. I got ya covered.

It's go time.

What in the world?

Where are we?

Oh my gosh! Have we been shrunk?! And...and look at us!

You know what the magic is for. We have to protect the world order!

Border?

I said,
!

Gawrsh...

Who's gonna protect the order from them?

Heartless!

Okay. We go on three. One, two...

Wait!

What are you doing?!

Who are those guys?

Are they new?

Wait! Ah-- Ah-- You look familiar!

I know this. You're, uh, you're, uhhh...

Yozora!

Huh? My name's Sora.

Stay back! For all we know, the intruders sent them.

Yozora!

Slow down there, Rex. We don't know them.

But we can trust them. They're the number-one-selling heroes in the country!

Yeah, Andy's mom must've bought 'em for him.

Hamm's right. Did you see how easily they took care of the intruders? I bet they're here to figure out why all our friends have gone missing, and why Buzz's laser started actually laser-ing...and all the weird stuff that's been going on.

I mean, that's what heroes do, right?

Let's not jump to conclusions.

Hmm...

Gotta be smart, Woody.

So, you're...Andy's new toys?

Toys?

You sure did a number on those intruders.

Those are the Heartless.

The bad guys!

We've been fighting against those
for a while.

I knew it!

Hmm... Okay.

Huh?

In that case, you're all right by me. My name's Woody. Put 'er there.

Hey.

Now hold on.

I'm Sora--

Yozora!

Actually, my name's
...

And I'm Donald.

I'm Goofy.

And I'm...Buzz Lightyear.

Call me Hamm. It's a real honor.

And I'm Rex! I'm your biggest fan. In fact, I've been playing your game for months now. And I've already gotten you all the way up to LV 47. But that Bahamut boss is really tough. Slinky and I can't figure out how to beat him.

Oh, I wish Slinky and the others were here. They'd be so happy to meet you!

All troops at attention, sir!

Weeee!

Strangers.

From the outside.

Welcome.

They're all toys? So that's why we look the way we do.

Excuse me. You said that you've battled those intruders before. Tell us where and why.

Oh... Well, uh...we are--

Order!

Well? You must have come from somewhere.

Take it easy, Buzz. What matters is that they got those intruders out of our way--for at least a little while.

No need to interrogate 'em.

Yeah, Buzz!

Woody's right.

Noted. But still...

Hey. Have those
--the Heartless--been a problem around here?

No, they just showed up a little while ago.

In fact, those
materialized...right after our friends up and vanished.

You don't think...

Well, gee. It can't just be a coincidence.

It wasn't always this lonely. One day we woke up, and we were the only toys left here. Nobody's heard from Mom, Molly, or Andy...

We keep waiting for Andy to come home.

You really care about him.

Yeah... He's the best friend that toys like us could ever hope to have.

All right. We'd better start looking!

Huh?

Have you gotten any clues we can go on--any other strange things that happened?

Well... Hmm. There's one thing.

One big thing.

Huge, sir.

What thing?

After everyone went MIA, the intruders didn't come alone. They arrived with a guy wearing a hood, dressed in black, just like you. As a matter of fact, he's the only other toy we've seen, outside of you three.

A black hood? (gasp) But that would mean...

The Organization!

You know who it is?

Yeah. They're bad news.

Seems like you have a lot of enemies.

We may have a hunch what's causing all the weirdness. Would you mind if we handle this?

I'm sorry. But we're not gonna leave this to you.

Huh?

If that guy had something to do with our friends vanishing, then he's our problem too. We've got to work together.

Right!

So then, were can we find that guy?

Sarge, any word from the recon team?

The latest reports place him in town, sir. At Galaxy Toys!

Then Galaxy Toys is where we're going. Sora. Follow me.

It's out the window and down the roof.

Not so fast, cowboy.

Hm?

You seem pretty gung ho about going, but shouldn't we stay here and wait for Andy?

Well... You've got a point, but...we've tried waiting. Look, if we go with Sora, we might find a clue. Are you with me, Buzz?

Of course. Okay, let's move out!

We're here!

Hey, why doesn't THAT toy move?

I guess it hasn't figured it out.

Figured what out?

I can make it move for you.

You're from the dream--the first of the Xehanorts!

I'm so honored you remember me.

Oh no! He CAN move!

Way cool!

Look out!

One heart's shadows fill the emptiness of another. See how they bring him to life? Like Heartless and Nobodies, they fit together.

Enough. Why are you doing this?!

There's a darkness we are missing and must reclaim. The way hearts connect in this world can provide us with a clue. So we made a copy of the world, and then pulled those hearts apart. I wonder how you'll handle the strain.

Wait! What does that mean?

Don't let me down.

Oh no!

Woody! What is going on? Is this toy a friend...or foe?

I think we've got our answer.

Sora! You're up!

Yeah! If the Heartless know how to do it, there's no reason you can't.

Do what?

Brilliant! I'm on it!

He was being controlled? He wasn't just switched into battle mode by accident?

Buzz?

It's nothing.

I'm confused. That guy in the black coat--did he say he made a copy of the real world? What's that mean?

It...prob'ly means they split this world in two--your friends in one world, us in the other. Only one of the worlds is real, and the other is just really convincing.

You can't be serious. Oh! That's right, you're from a video game. Well, maybe in your game, that's how things work...but here in reality, you can't


This is ridiculous.

Woody, let's go.

I admit, it does sound just a little far-fetched.

But...say we HAVE been taken to some kind of alternate world. That would explain why your laser's real. And is it really that crazy? Worse than
and
? Any of that ring a bell?

Point taken. But that just means these strangers are part of the delusion. And I say it's time we parted ways and went home.

Thought we were friends, not strangers.

Look, I get that it seems weird, but we know something's wrong with this place. We should stick together.

Sora's right. They helped with the intruders, so they might help find our friends.

They have been there for us so far. You can't deny that. Come on. Every toy deserves a fair shake. Am I right?

Tell it to that toy over there.

Sheriff, sir!

Rex has just been dino-napped!

What's that?!

My men saw him get hauled up to the second floor, sir! And Hamm and the Aliens are MIA.

Come on. We have got to find them!

Please, let us help!

Yeah!

Well, Buzz? Do you really think we can save our friends on our own? We didn't get very far before. We gotta take all the help we can get.

Don't worry. Sora can be reckless...

Wha?

...and Donald grumbles a lot.

Huh?

It's true.

But you can trust 'em!

Hey! He suspects you, too!

It's true.

Huh? He does?

See, they don't seem bad. Am I right, Buzz?

Okay, fine. We do need the extra help. But just so we're clear: I remain skeptical about this. I'll work with you till we find our friends.

Ohhh...kay.

Thanks for the help, Sora, Donald, Goofy.

My troops will return to the field, sir!

This ascent is gonna be rather tricky.

Too bad we're not strapped to a rocket, huh?

Hey! Think we could use that?

It's perfect. C'mon, guys!

Rex!

Where'd he go?

You sure you saw him?

Yes, he just--

Shh. Do you guys hear something?

What's that?

Something feels wrong...

Another toy's being controlled!

Buzz, you sure?

If it wanted to play nice, then it should've stayed away from my friends.

What's this?!

Oh no! What did I do?!

Nice moves, Rex.

That was great!

Great? Really? Would you say I was impressive?

Very impressive, Rex. We couldn't look away.

Hurray! Oh, that makes me so happy!

Were you watching too? Did you see what I did?

Yeah, good for you.

Listen, Rex.

I was going for fearsome...

Would ya--

...but I think I might've actually achieved something close to terrifying!

Earth to Rex.

Do you know where the others were taken?

What do you mean? Did something bad happen?

Back to square one.

Oh, great.

Sarge! Have you got a status report?

Sir! One of my men just located Hamm forward of our position, in Babies in Toddlers.

The corporal was debriefing him, but something must have gone wrong. All radio contact has been lost.

Anything more specific we can go on?

Right before I lost contact, I heard music with some sort of sonic interference.

Music?

Ya think it could be the Heartless?

What if it's another big monster?

Let's find out.

I agree.

Actually...I think I'll head back and wait by the entrance. I'm sure those vents are gonna be much too narrow for my big dinosaur tail.

Really? I'm sure you'd fit.

Rex is right. Besides, we need a lookout at th e entrance. It's an important mission. Can you do it?

Yes, sir!

This is Babies and Toddlers. Where do you guys think we should start?

Sarge, didn't you mention music?

Affirmative, Goofy.

Hmm... All right. Why don't we look for things that make noise?

Sure!

That's good thinking for you.

Wha... What do you mean, for me?

Hey, where ya--

Donald!

I think they really are good guys.

Hold still!

Well, you wouldn't have trusted them otherwise.

What?

Missed me!

Don't!

And I know that your trust is a hard-earned treasure.

No! Stop that!

Victor!

Well...for all our sakes, let's hope you're right, cowboy. I'm willing to give 'em a chance at least for a little while longer. Especially if it means getting Andy and our friends back.

Agreed.

Is this it?

Come on, Sora... You've never used a record player?

Huh?

Like this!

It's workin'!

Wait, did that sound off to you?

It did.

Huh?

Heeey!

Sora! There's some kinda strange noise comin' from the orchestra!

Got it! Woody, you keep the record going.

Whoa-whoa-whoa!

Hmm... Somethin' seems to be stuck in this tuba.

I'll get it out.

Almost got it...

There!

Corporal!

You all right, son?

Yes, sir.

That's the soldier Sarge lost contact with.

So you found Hamm?

Yes. But...while I was radioing in, a giant hand grabbed me, and it stuffed me in there. They must have taken Hamm to another location. We have to hurry!

Wait, Corporal. You're not fit for action.

But Sarge...

Your tour is over, son. And it's all right. Our trusted allies will take over.

I will move the corporal to a safer location.

Good luck, gentlemen.

Huh...?

Hey, hey, hey, hey! What is...going on?!

Oh, right!

Woody! Mission complete!

Why didn't...you tell me...a little sooner?

Sorry, there's no time to rest. Hamm needs us.

Talk about cabin fever. Thanks for the save.

You okay, Hamm?

Yeah, aside from being locked in, the accomodations were fine.

Aww. What a tiny little house.

Huh?

Who was--

What's wrong?

She's back! That's the doll that pig-penned me!

Hamm, take cover.

Uh, copy that. One stay in the dread-and-breakfast was enough for me!

Not another possessed toy...

Guys, look alive!

Wait... What if we end up just like her? Forgetting ourselves and... attacking each other?

No way, Buzz. That won't happen.

No way!

You guys are too strong.

You can't be sure! What if I get taken over, then attack you?

Buzz, you're overthinking it.

Yeah. The Heartless--the darkness--can only creep in when our hearts falter. Trust me. You'll be fine if you don't lose heart.

Well, that's good. Because I know you, Buzz. You'll never lose heart when it comes to your friends.

True enough, cowboy.

Sorry to have worried you all.

No problem. Now, let's go find the others.

Look!

A flying saucer!

I think I know who that might lead us to. C'mon, guys!

Hey, Woody. I'd just slow you down, with all the loose change I'm carrying. I'll hang by the entrance.

No problem. Be safe, Hamm.

Hey, thanks, buddy. You just take care of your old self.

Now, let's follow that UFO!

Right!

They have come for us.

The mystic portal awaits.

Oh no!

Wait!

Stop!

Farewell!

It's getting away!

Don't go!

We are back!

Our ship is no more.

Nirvana will not be reached.

Sorry I trashed your ride.

Fear not.

We still have our new home.

The Chamber of Andy.

They're right.

This isn't where we belong. We've been in this toy store long enough. It's time for us to go home to Andy's room.

But...Xehanort told us that room isn't even his real room.

Can you prove that any of that nonsense is true?

And even if that Andy's room IS fake, it doesn't mean he's not somewhere in this world with us. I'm going home to wait for him. No more debate.

You with me, Woody?

Hmm... Youre right, Buzz. Now that we're all accounted for, we should meet up at the entrance and go home.

Okay. We could have used friends like you for the final showdown...

But Organization XIII's our problem to solve.

Yeah, I can take 'em!

I'm not so sure about that...

I'll show ya!

Guys, can we see you off?

That would be great.

Sarge, roll call.

Sir, yes sir! Roll call! All toys, fall in!

Sarge... Army Men times four... Hamm... Aliens 1, 2, 3...

Wait. Where's Rex?

Aw, he took off. Said he wanted to prove to you you could trust Sora. He's up there by the video games.

Well, here we go again.

Huh? This is about us?

He's not safe. The Heartless are out there.

You're right. Sora, Donald, Goofy... Any chance you could help us one last time?

Sure!

Of course!

You bet!

Thanks, guys.

Hurray!

Look! Look! I found it!

See, Sora?

Well, I never look THIS good. The clothes kinda match.

Whaddaya know! They ARE video game figures. See? I told ya, Buzz. They're toys, just like the rest of us.

Well, I suppose.

Donald, I thought your magic decided how I look. Explain.

Simple. That's not you.

Say, Riku would make a great action figure!

Must be him!

No! It's me. I've got the black clothes and, uh...

So what?

All right, everyone. Now that we're back together, it's time to return to Andy's room.

Now?

But can't I at least check the strategy guides? I want to know how to beat Bahamut!

Next time. Right now, we need to go home.

Oh, but you needn't rush off.

Xehanort!

I have more to observe. I can't let you leave yet.

It's us that you really want. Leave the others out of this.

You WOULD say that, champion of light.

Very well, let's skip to the final stage.

Buzz? What's the matter?

C'mon, Buzz. Quit fooling around.

Look out!

I can't believe it! Buzz has been taken over?

What did you do to him?!

I thought I made it clear. I am testing the strength of their bonds.

In this world, toys have hearts. And those hearts come from a powerful bond.

So what happens when those bonds are stretched to their limit? When they are worlds apart, can cloth and plastic hold on to their hearts?

All I needed was a wedge to widen the divide--someone like you to fill them with distrust and doubt.

And that chasm you created can be filled with a vast darkness.

Witness it for yourself.

Sora!

Do somethiiing!

On my way!

Not this time!

Where am I?

Haven't you heard? In this world, you come from a video game. So now, you can watch my experiment from inside that screen. That is...if you manage to find a moment's rest.

There's got to be a way out. Buzz, Woody, hang on!

Sora!

Y'all right, Sora?

Yeah, I'm just fine. And you?

Wait... Where's Buzz?

He disappeared into a dark corridor.

Oh...

Sora, how do we get him back?

I don't know. My power won't open those.

Sir, did I hear you say
?

That's right, Sarge. Any ideas?

Well, it might be a long shot, but we've sighted a shadowy portal in the Kid Korral. We can infiltrate from a window inside Babies and Toddlers.

I'll head there and get it open.

Sarge, you're a lifesaver!

You guys in?

Yeah!

Please promise you'll bring Buzz home.

With batteries included?

Journey safely.

Farewell!

Don't worry. WE'RE gonna get our friend back.

Sora, look!

That must be the window Sarge mentioned.

The entrance was blocked by BLOCKS?

Can you use the Gigas to move 'em?

Yeah, maybe. I'll try.

Up there!

How we gonna reach that?

Well, there ARE some more blocks here...

We'll need more than that.

Getting closer.

Hey, is that...

A cactus?

Yep, and it's our way up to the dark corridor.

It looked like this?

Yup.

Here goes.

Buzz!

Xehanort!

What do you want with my friend?

Look... Such tremendous darkness. All because he was ripped away from the boy who cares about him most.

Does that mean...we'll all be like Buzz...

...if we don't...find Andy?

Wrong! Distance doesn't matter. Andy's part of their hearts, just like my friends are part of mine.

You can't rip that apart!

What?
? Ah... How very true. But if the light of friendship is a form of power...the darkness of being alone is a power...even greater. Darkness is the heart's true nature.

Whatever you're talking about, I don't care. Put Buzz back the way he was, then get lost!

Or else what, toy?

Yeah, I am a toy. And a friend.

My guess is no one's ever loved you before. Because you know NOTHING about hearts and love.

There are hearts all around us, trying to connect. Your
only made Woody and Buzz's connection stronger. THAT's the heart's true nature--to never, ever let go. Wherever they are, Andy and the other toys haven't let go either.

Yeah! You can't keep us from Andy. We're going home no matter what. And taking Buzz!

Xehanort, you're so caught up in finding the shadows, you forgot about the light that cast them.

No!

Woody, now!

Woody... Wait, how did I get here?

Hmm. Oh, I don't know! (elbows him) Maybe somebody switched you into
mode.

But I don't have a--

Thank you, Woody.

Good to have ya back, Buzz.

Hey, hurry up!

We can't hold him much longer!

Don't give up, guys!

So, even empty puppets can be given strong hearts. I am going to have to remember that.

Remember this--our hearts will always be connected to Andy's. No matter what you do!

And that's something you'll never understand, because you're hollower than any toy.

But now I know a heart can be placed in the vessel of our choosing. For that, let me give you a parting gift to play with.

Wait!

Find the hearts joined to yours.

Huh?

There!

Careful!

Here goes.

So, Xehanort got away again.

Yeah, he's a big chicken.

I'm sorry!

I wanted to get you back to the real world.

It does seem that we're trapped here.

We'll never get home.

Yeah, stuck like pigs.

Our position appears fixed.

Oh nooo.

A shame we'll have to stay a little longer...with our new best friends.

Huh?

After all the adventures we've had, we're not quite ready to say,


You guys...

I'm sorry that I was being so stubborn. Please forgive me.

Hey, you were just looking out for your friends. No biggie.

Yeah, somebody's gotta be the sensible one, especially since Woody's always gettin' in trouble.

Gawrsh, that sounds a little like Sora, don't it?

Yeah, and I'm the dependable one!

Like Buzz! ...Kinda.

Besides, if we do go back to the real world, we'll never see you again, right?

But...what about Andy? You care about him so much.

And he's still right here with us.

If we follow our hearts, we'll find him again.

Yeah!

So, Sora, are you goin' after the guy in the black coat?

Something tells me we can't join you on that mission.

That's okay...because you've become part of our hearts.

So let us become a part of yours.

Thank you!

Now, off you go. To infinity and beyond!

Sora, what about the
?

You HAD to remind me?

Well, gawrsh, we just wanna help keep ya motivated.

I was thinking about Roxas. He's trapped here in my heart. But... he needs a body to be himself again.

Aw, don't worry. Ienzo's workin' on a way to get him free. I'll betcha he's got the perfect body all lined up.

You've got the Gummiphone, Sora. Why don't ya try givin' him a call?

Uhh, I guess so?

Yeah, why not.

Oh! Hiya, Sora!

Your Majesty!

Hey! Wha...? Wrong number?

No, Riku and I are visiting Radiant Garden. Actually, we were just about to call you guys, but it looks like you beat us to the punch.

Sora, is something wrong?

I wanted to pick your brain. In order for us to recomplete Roxas, he needs a body, right?

Yeah, to put his heart in.

Replicas...

Huh?

Well, replicas are basically human.

Uh, what?

Oh, yeah... You wouldn't remember. The previous Organization XIII developed
: realistic vessels to place hearts in. They're so real, in fact, that you'd actually mistake them for people. And with hearts, the replicas will BECOME people.

Cool, but if we get our hands on a replica, will Roxas look like himself when he's recompleted?

Yup. The replica takes the form of the heart inside it.

That's perfect!

I'll talk to Ienzo. He was in the Organization back then, so he might know more.

Great. Thanks. Wait... (to Donald & Goofy) Do you guys think THEY'RE after replicas too?

No, they definitely said


Who's that?

The Organization and Maleficent.

I guess we forgot to mention it.

Aw, it's okay. But there's something you guys should know about one of their members.

Huh?

So, let the rest of us worry about Roxas and Naminé for now. You journey on, and keep an eye out for Terra.

Yes, Your Majesty!

Stop that!

They don't change, do they?

Nope, that's their best quality.

Welp, we gave Merlin the vestments for Kairi and Axel. Let's go stop by Ansem the Wise's study.

Right.

Why can't I go outside?

The outside world is a dangerous place. You must stay here, where you're safe. Do you understand, flower?

Those lights appear every year on my birthday--only on my birthday. And I can't help but feel like they're...they're meant for me. I need to see them. And not just from my window... In person. I have to know what they are.

It sure is a pretty day.

Yeah, the weather is great. It'd be perfect for a picnic.

Why do you think we came HERE?

Got me, Donald.

We'll figure it out as we go.

Okay.

I'm sure we were brought to this world for SOME good reason, but can't we sweat it later?

Fine with me, as long as there's no Heartless.

Make way! Make way! Make way!

Heartless!

You see? Soon as you mention 'em, they show up!

There goes our picnic.

I didn't do it!

S'okay. Let's send these guys packing.

Say, since you three seem to know what you're doing, mind if I leave this one to you?

Yup. We'll take care of them. Go on, skedaddle!

You have my thanks.

The horse was enough. Don't need any monsters on my trail.

The WHAT was enough?

Oh, nothing, nothing. Name's Flynn. Flynn Rider. (pointing) Ohh! Watch out, they look mad!

Slowly... Slowly... Outta here!

Huh? Where'd Flynn go?

He skedaddled.

I think I saw him go thataway.

Huh? But
is...just a dead end.

Yeah. That's puzzling.

Well, did he?

I say we investigate.

He couldn't have come this way.

Well, at least he got away safe. Right?

Hey! Now Sora's gone, too!

This way, guys! It's a secret passage!

How you doing? The name's Flynn Rider. How's your day going? Huh?

Who else knows my location, Flynn Rider?

All right, hang on, Blondie.

Rapunzel.

Gesundheit. Here's the deal. I was in a situation, gallivanting through the forest when I stumbled upon a--

Oh! Oh no no! No no no! Where is my satchel?

I've hidden it. Somewhere you'll never find it.

So, what do you want with my hair? To cut it? Sell it?

Sell it?

No!

Wait. You DON'T want my hair?

Why on earth would I want your hair? Look, I was being chased, I saw a tower, I climbed it, okay? End of story.

Okay, Flynn Rider. I'm prepared to offer you a deal.

A deal?

Look this way.

Do you know what these are?

You mean the lantern thing they do for the princess?

Lanterns? I knew they weren't stars. Well, tomorrow evening they will light the night sky with these


YOU will act as my guide, take me to these lanterns, and return me home safely. Then, and only then, will I return your satchel to you. That is my deal.

Yeah... No can do. Unfortunately...

...the Kingdom and I aren't exactly
at the moment,

...so I won't be taking you anywhere.

Something brought you here, Flynn Rider.

Call it what you will:fate, destiny...

So I have made the decision to trust you.

A horrible decision, really.

I am serious.

Let me get this straight. I take you to see the lanterns, bring you back home...then you'll give me back my satchel?

I promise.

And when I promise something, I never, ever break that promise.

Ever.

Oh, what to do? I cannot let her find that tiara. Okay, just think... I need the satchel and Blondie has it. There might be more monsters out there... I've got it! The three guys in the funny outfits. They looked tough enough to come in handy.

All right fine, I'll take you.

But on one condition: my three sidekicks come along.

Look at that. A tower! Let's check it out!

It's so soft!

I'm free... I'm really free!

Flynn, good to see you in one piece!

Guys! You're here, and just in time.

Oh... Who's she?

Uh, that would be Rapunzel.

Something tells me this could be her first time outdoors. Give her a few minutes to get used to it.

First time EVER?

I can't believe I did this!

I can't believe I did this.

I can't believe I DID this!

Mother would be so furious if she knew I disobeyed her and left the tower...

But that's okay--I mean, what she doesn't know won't kill her... Right?

Oh my gosh. This would kill her.

This is so fuuuuuun!

I am a horrible daughter. I'm going back.

I am never going back!

I am a despicable human being.

Best. Day. Ever!

I notice you seem a little at war with yourself here.

A little MORE than a little.

More like a lot.

Yeah...

Stop right there! Who are you?

I told you before: my sidekicks.

Sidekicks?

May I introduce, ehh...

Oh, uh... My name's Sora.

Donald!

And I'm Goofy. Pleasure, ma'am.

Sora, Donald, and...Goofy.

It's...nice to meet you, too. I'm Rapunzel.

Yep. My sidekicks.

Since when is THAT?

Look, she really wants to see the lantern show tomorrow night. Now, I'm a nice guy, so I've decided to help her. Only problem is those monsters might show up again. I can get her to the Kingdom--but you guys are clearly more cut out for combat.

That's cause we're heroes!

Uh-huh!

And we're Heartless experts.

Yeah, yeah!

Just leave it to us!

Done.

Rapunzel is interesting...

Yeah, her heart's pulling her all kinda ways.

The outside world must seem so big and scary. I know how she feels. Lucky for me you two came along at just the right time--and the rest has been unforgettable.

Awww...

Yep, unforgettable...just like your face!

Oh yeah?!

C'mon, now.

All for one, and one for all.

Oh, look. What is that? It's so fluffy!

Heartless!

Rapunzel, take cover!

All right, I hate to say it, but I'm lettin' you outta this deal.

What?

It's way too scary out here. Let's just turn around and take you home.

No. I am seeing those lanterns.

Oh, come on!

Rapunzel?

It's okay. I'm not afraid to face them.

Rapunzel?

Rapunzel!

Missing someone?

Who's there?

She's such a precious gift. Allow me to assist you in getting her back.

Dandelions!

Look! Watch.

Oh yeah, I thought that might work. But I wish there was a way to make more fly at once.

They're just like the floating lights.

Rabbits!

Heartless!

Oh, no, you're not picking on these rabbits.

Don't worry. It's safe now.

Oh, maybe they want to show us something. Let's follow them!

I think they want us to have this.

Thank you.

Look at all this water!

It's so refreshing! You have to come in.

See? It feels nice.

My turn.

Sora!

Okay. You're in for it!

Whoa!

A rainbow!

Okay. That's suspicious.

Rapunzel...

Don't worry. I know to be careful around flowers now.

Whatever it is, it's not normal. I'll take a look.

Watch it.

We're all clear.

Sora!

These guys?

They're Nobodies!

Mother said the outside world would be full of ruffians and thugs.

Those aren't ruffians. Those are...uhh, I dunno...

Rapunzel, Flynn, stay back!

No. I want to help you fight.

I know. But I'm afraid you can't hurt these guys with a frying pan. Trust me on this. Flynn, could you explain?

No problem. Knowing when to flee is one of my specialties.

C'mon, Rapunzel. Gotta go.

But--

Look, I wanna stay and slug it out too, but my sidekicks have it covered.

All right. Please be careful, Sora.

You know who uses Nobodies...

The Organization!

Yeah. I'm surprised we haven't seen 'em. (calling out) I know you're there! Come out, you has-beens!


? Now why would you say that?

Because, bossing around Nobodies? That's the old Organization.
Why? Are you in the
one too? Good for you.

My name is Marluxia, and yes, that is correct. How interesting it is to see you again, Sora.


?

YOU know 'im?

A shame you've no memory of me, because I remember you exceedingly well. Although...it's THOSE memories I'd soon erase.

I don't know what you're saying.

Nor should you. Nor will you ever, for that matter.

Now, if you'll permit me, I've come to ask a favor.

Favor? You have got to be kidding me.

Please hear what I have to say. I'm sure you've noticed...

Well, perhaps not. But you should know that maiden with you, Rapunzel, is the very light of this world. I would see you guard her from its dark horrors.

Huh?

Starting with you, right?

All the Organization seeks is balance. You must understand, our ultimate objective is not to clash with the light. We seek to complement it. Use that Keyblade...to keep Rapunzel safe.

Rapunzel's light...

Hey. Where did they go?

I guess they musta run on ahead.

Then we'd better go find them.

This might be a good spot to find some ingredients.

I wonder where they went.

Don't worry. They couldn't have gotten too far.

You just had to stop and talk.

Hey! Blame the has-been, not me.

I think you mean Marluxia. I bet that's the name the has-been would prefer.

Hellooo? Rapunzel? Flynn?

Excuse me, good travelers. Do you know Rapunzel?

Uh, yeah... Sort of.

Why?

My apologies. I'm Rapunzel's mother. The poor child left home without a word, and I've just been worried sick. Please tell me: where is my dear, sweet girl?

We'd tell ya, but we lost her.

By accident.

We could look together.

Lost her? (scoffs) You're of no use to me.

I'll find her myself.

She ran away from home?

What if Marluxia was onto something back there?

You trust Organization XIII?

What? No! Of course not. But...what if?

I agree. Why is Rapunzel in danger, and what darkness is after her?

Well, guys, the first step is to find her.

Wh-wh-whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy, boy, easy! Settle down. Whoa, whoa!

That voice!

It's Rapunzel!

You are such a good boy! Yes you are.

Are you all tired from chasing this bad man all over the place?

Excuse me?

Nobody appreciates you, do they?

Do they?

Oh, come on. He's a bad horse!

Ohhh. He's nothing but a big sweetheart.

Isn't that right...

Maximus?

Wha... You've got to be kidding me.

Look, today is kind of the biggest day of my life, and the thing is, I need you NOT to get him arrested.

Just for twenty-four hours, and then you can chase each other to your hearts' content. Okay?

And it's also my birthday. Just so you know.

Rapunzel!

You're here. And you're okay!

Yeah! You too.

And look! I made a friend.

Meet Maximus. You could say Flynn introduced us. And where one goes, the other follows.

This is Sora, Goofy, and Donald. They've been helping me.

Come on, the Kingdom's not far.

Whoa, what? It transformed!

What is it with me and horses?

Oh, look! I see some birds! This way!

Wait! Come back! I must have startled them.

I've never seen a bird like you.

Listen. They're singing for us!

I just knew the outside world would be full of amazing things!

And you...you helped me find them. Thank you.

Rapunzel sure looks happy.

She does.

Well, her dream's gonna come true. They're sendin' the lanterns up after dark.

Cool! We don't wanna miss that!

It's for the lost princess.

C'mon, everyone! Come dance with us!

This is so fun!

Hey!

To the boats!

I've been looking out a window for eighteen years, dreaming about what it might feel like when those lights rise in the sky. What if it's not everything I dreamed it would be?

It will be.

And what if it is? What do I do then?

Well, that's the good part, I guess. You get to go find a new dream.

I have something for you, too.

I should have given it to you before, but I was just scared. And the thing is, I'm not scared anymore. You know what I mean?

I'm starting to.

I'm sorry. Everything is fine. There's...just something I have to take care of.

Okay.

I'll be right back.

It's all right, Pascal.

Wow!

Could you guys have possibly picked a worse time?

I don't think they appreciate the moment, Sora.

Not one bit!

It's time for these wet blankets to go!

Yeah!

Eugene?

Eugene!

Oh dear... He's run off with the crown and forgotten you.

No. He wouldn't. Who are you?

Forget Flynn Rider. You know where you belong, and it's not with him. Now...

Rapunzel!

Mother?

Oh, my precious girl!

Mother...

Are you all right? Are you hurt?

M-Mother, how did you--

I was so worried about you, dear. So I followed you. And I saw them attack you, and--

Oh my. Let's go. Let's go, before they come to.

Hey, isn't that Rapunzel?

Wait! Rapunz--

Show some decorum.

You again!

Marluxia!

The girl has found her dear mother. You should let them be.

And why is that?

Because Rapunzel is far too important. Atop her tower, she must remain out of sight, and live out her days with Mother Gothel.

And never see anyone else?

But that's like...locking her in some prison!

That is EXACTLY what it's like. Rapunzel's hair holds the powerful magic of healing. And yes, Mother Gothel wants it for herself. As do others. And, if Mother Gothel's actions will protect Rapunzel, preserve her...then she is doing the Organization a favor.

What favor?

Let's say she's keeping Rapunzel on the shelf for us. An extra pawn in case you fail to find the remaining guardians of light, and we have occasion to call on other hearts of light instead. A New Seven Hearts to fill out the ranks.


?

Yes. Seven who inherited the princesses' light after their role was fulfilled.

So, you don't care about her. You guys just want Rapunzel for your own purposes! Well, you're done here!

Hmph. I just knew you would go and make a scene. Very well, then it's lights out for you.

Sora!

You always were such a sound sleeper.

I am the lost princess.

Please speak up, Rapunzel. You know how I hate the mumbling.

I am the lost princess. Aren't I?

Did I mumble, Mother? Or should I even call you that?

Oh, Rapunzel. Do you even hear yourself?

Why would you ask such a ridiculous question?

It was you! It was ALL you!

Everything I did was to protect YOU.

Rapunzel...

I've spent my entire life hiding from people who would use me for my power...

Rapunzel!

When I should have been hiding from you!

Where will you go? He won't be there for you.

What did you do to him?

That criminal's to be hanged for his crimes.

No...

Now, now, it's all right. Listen to me. All of this is as it should be.

No! You were wrong about the world. And you were wrong about me.

And I will NEVER let you use my hair again!

You want me to be the bad guy? Fine. Now I'm the bad guy.

Whoa, Max! Whoa, boy.

Flynn!

Is Sora okay?

We don't know.

We keep callin' his name and shakin' him, but he won't open his eyes.

Sora!

Wake up!

Hmm... Unresponsive sidekick... Wait a minute. I know how to fix this! Max, give him a wash!

Sora!

Well, that did the trick. Nice work, Max!

Huh? How did I end up...

Oh no! Flynn, Rapunzel's being held prisoner!

That's right. In her mother's tower.

This calls for a rescue.

Are you with me?

Yeah.

Uh-oh!

Let's go, Max.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Max!

We'll take it from here, Flynn. Go help Rapunzel.

Thanks!

Rapunzel! I thought I'd never see you again.

Rapunzel, really! Enough already! Stop fighting me!

No! I won't stop! For every minute of the rest of my life, I will fight! I will never stop trying to get away from you! But...if you let me save him, I will go with you.

No! No, Rapunzel...

I'll never run... I'll never try to escape. Just let me heal him...and you and I will be together--forever, just like you want. Every- thing will be the way it was. I promise. Just like you want. Just...let me heal him.

In case you get any ideas about following us.

Eu...Eugene!

Oh, I'm so sorry. Everything is gonna be okay, though.

No...Rapunzel...

I promise. You have to trust me.

No! I can't let you do this.

And I can't let you die.

But if you do this...

...but if you do this, then you will die.

Hey. It's gonna be all right.

Rapunzel... Wait.

Eugene, what--

No!

Oh no. No...

What have you done? What have you DONE?!

Fallen to darkness... We can't allow her near our pure light now. Her presence would only cast a pall over it.

What happened up there?

I don't know, but we have to stop that Heartless.

Don't go. Stay with me, Eugene.

Flower, gleam and glow. Let your power shine. Make the clock reverse.

Rapunzel.

Bring back what once was mine.

Hey. Rapunzel.

What?

Rapunzel... You were my new dream.

And you were mine.

Heal what has been hurt. Change the Fates' design. Save what has been lost. Bring back what once was mine.

What once was mine.

Rapunzel...

Eugene.

Did I ever tell you...I've got a thing for brunettes?

Eugene!

Wow, Rapunzel! You're finally gonna get to see your real home.

I know! I mean...I can't believe it. I can finally be with my real family! I couldn't have done it without your help.

You're welcome.

Well, from where I'm standing, the Kingdom couldn't ask for a better princess. And I couldn't have asked for better sidekicks!

Thanks.

Yes, thank you so much.

Happily ever after.

Mm-hmm.

Now, Flynn, you and Maximus play nice.

Huh?

Fine.

You're gonna be great.

Huh?

We haven't seen the guy controlling the monsters in a while, so that's one less worry.

But there's still a chance that he might be around here somewhere.

Well, if he comes back and tries to bother Rapunzel again, then Flynn will keep her safe. And we three wont be far behind.

Come on. Rapunzel's the tough one, if you ask me.

True. But nevertheless, I won't let her out of my sight.

Oh... Eugene.


?

Oh! That's my real name. Eugene Fitzherbert. That's right. I never told you guys.

That's different.

I think it's a great name!

Me too. Nice to re-meet you, Eugene.

Hey! I thought I was the only one you were going to tell.

Don't worry. I've saved plenty of Fitzherbert-y secrets just for you.

Really?

Hey! What are you two lovebirds talking about?

Nothing!

Nothing.

Hey, you can tell us!

Yeah, it's not nice to keep secrets.

This one is none of your business.

Maximus, get him!

Huh?

You have got to be kidding me!

ANOTHER world where we got doodly-squat.

Hmph.

You sure this box thingy's even real?

Yes.

Yeah, and just how do you know that?

It is etched.

It's what?

Come with me.

Where to? Those bozos ain't gonna help us. Sora's sure not lookin' for the box.

Who said anything about following them?

What? We're too late?

Yes. Even would know about the replicas from his time as Vexen in the Organization. He was recompleted like the rest of us, but he didn't regain consciousness. After Lea left, he must have woken and taken his leave. Aeleus here and Dilan went out and turned the whole town upside down to try and find him. But no Even.

That's not good.

What about his research?

Unfortunately, his work on the replicas was incomplete. There may still be documents around, but all of them from well before he made any significant progress.

Do you have any idea where he might go?

There's no place that he could go now that he's human. He has no means of leaving this world.

The dark corridors--

Are beyond his faculties and mine now.

But not everyone's. What if Even was taken?

Of course! The Organization could also use the replicas!

To fill out their ranks.

We'd better go tell Master Yen Sid. And Sora, and the others, too!

Humanity is a precious gift. And yet you desire to return to the Organization?

Oh, yes...of course. One eradication at Axel's hands was enough to learn where NOT to place my trust.

He gave you a second lease on life.

He ripped me away from the one thing I care about. I don't require humanity. Give me my research. I must see it to fruition, no matter the cost.

The replicas.

Yes.

Soon they will replace, not just replicate. Given a heart, they can become just as real as any human.

What excellent tidings. I would hate to think we invited you back into our ranks only for you to fail to deliver our final vessel...

Vexen.

Ha! My bistro's future is lookin' bright. The new recipes are a smash! Those ingredients of yours must really have got Little Chef's gears a-turnin'.

Soon, we'll be chasing customers away. Keep up the good work!

We try! Right, Little Chef?

Wha...? D-Donald... Goofy... Why do you guys look like monsters?

You do too!

Well, ya both scared me.

Seriously? Is THIS how we blend in here?

That's right. It's about time you caught on.

Could you guys take a few steps back? You're givin' me the heebie- jeebies.

YOU take a step back!

Come on, I think our new look could turn out to be lots of fun!

Wonder what kind of weirdos live here...

Who'da thunk he'd get so creeped out?

It says,
?

That's odd.

Doesn't sound very caring.

If they look like us, then they could be trouble. I think we'd better investigate.

Oh no!

Weeee!

Boo!

Hmm? I wonder who those guys are.

What?! Careful, Sulley. If they see the K-I-D...

It's fine. We got nothing to hide.

But you're the CEO! You set the example.

Guys! Guys, it's not what it looks like. Okay, listen. That kid over there just popped out of nowhere!

We gotta call the CDA. Uh... It's a...uh... Oh yeah, a Code 835!

Are you trying to scare that little girl?

Yes! I mean, no no no!

We're done with scare power. Nobody's gettin' scared.

Mike, take it easy.

You should too, Sora. Ya see? She's happy!

Oh.

Hello. My name is Sora.

Boo.

Oh, is that your name? Nice to meet you, Boo.

Hold on! You guys really aren't afraid of humans?

Mike Wazowski.

Come on, Boo! I'M Mike Wazowski.

Mike Wazowski.

Well, you can see the resemblance. That googly bear eye.

What's going on? I'm Donald Duck!

Mike Wasowski!

A-hyuck! I'm Goofy.

Well, my name's Sulley. And this is--

Oh, we know. Mike Wazowski, right?

What's the matter, Boo?

Heartless!

No... That's not the Heartless's emblem!

Then, what?

And how come I feel like I mighta seen 'em before?

Well, they aren't friendly.

Stay here. Kitty will be back.

Those guys are right, Sulley. This has got
written all over it.

Yeah, we gotta keep Boo safe.

I'm on it.

All right!

Nice, Sulley. Even with those extra pounds you put on.

Heh, still runnin' circles around you, butterball.

Kitty!

So, any idea who those guys were?

Well...they couldn't have been Heartless...

Hmm... It's on the tip of my tongue. I remember the King told us somethin' about...nega-tive emotions.

Unversed?

Oh yeah! Them!

Unversed...?

Uh-huh. A while back, the King fought a whole bunch of battles against 'em with the three missing Keyblade wielders.

The same three that we're looking for? Aqua, Terra, and Ventus?

Uh-huh. We need more dependable help than YOU!

Hey!

Still, how come the Unversed are showin' up now?

Is it because they use scream power?

Hey, I told you we're through using that!

Besides, we have no idea who or what you're talking about.

Oh, you'd really like the King--

Uh-oh!

Order!

Ummm...basically...we've come from far away to get rid of those creatures causing trouble. We're like...exterminators?

Just HOW far away?

As far as you can imagine.

Hmm... Okay, okay, let's just say we buy all that. Are those creeps dangerous?

Extremely!

They sure gave Boo a scare.

Sulley, I know you've missed her, but it's time to postpone our playdate.

You're right, Mikey. Let's get our girl home.

What are you planning to do?

It's kind of a long story...but Boo's from another world...and we gotta send her back there...to keep her safe.

Okay, then. We're gonna help you.

What?!

Well, the Unversed might try to cause more trouble, so, we wanna come along.

Great!

We could use a couple of exterminators around here!

Yeah, thanks.

You've always gotta help.

Hey, they need us. Besides, we need to figure out how all those Unversed got here.

Gotta send her home right now, or so help me... So help me! So help me!

So, Monsters, Incorporated used to rely on scream power from human kids for energy, but now we collect their laughter instead. It turns out laughter's ten times more powerful.

Kitty!

And we'd never have figured it out without Boo.

Cool.

Our ship's powered by laughter, too! Guess we've got that in common.

Sora's a laughter machine!

Come on, I am not.

Unversed are back!

This is terrible!

Look! There's Boo's door!

Go get Boo!

We'll have to play another time, Boo. You stay here.

Ready to clean house?

Ride's here!

Nice.

Grab on to the door when you're ready.

Got it.

Ready!

Boo? Hold on. Don't want you to get hurt.

Boo's door, here we come!

Oh, I just got a great idea.

Heartless!

Not here too?!

Keep Boo out of harm's way. We'll handle the bad guys!

It's offline!

We have to power it up!

More bad guys!

Don't worry. I'll watch Boo.

'Kay!

Yeah!

Sora, we gotta make Boo laugh to open the door! Hurry! Help me take out these goons.

More of 'em?

Hey, what are we doing?!

Whoa, am I dizzy!

The door's open!

Boo's door!

Ready? It's time to hitch another ride.

Cool.

There's Boo's door!

Whoa!

Boo's door should be right around here somewhere.

Everybody look!

There it is!

Wait! How'd we take a wrong turn?

Who cares? All that matters...

...is that it's the last turn that you losers are ever gonna take.

Randall?!

Who's he?

A creep we banished for trying to collect screams by force. He used to be Boo's scarer.


How did you even get back here? The door we sent you through is sawdust!

Yeah, and I almost got turned into somebody's wallet. Lucky more me, a real nice guy came along and fixed the door. So here I am.

And starting today, I'm numero uno! Top of the leaderboard, baby.

Ha! You, a top laugh collector?

In your dreams, Randall. My laugh totals are off the charts.

Who said anything about collecting laughs? I'm after negative emotions.

And my new factory friends have kindly invaded the factory to get 'em for me.

Negative emotions?

He's gotta know.

Yeah, Organization XIII must be helpin' him.

Laughter's just not sustainable. Once junior chorts his last chortle, you've gotta start over. But negative energy? Especially sadness? Give 'em something that really breaks their little hearts, and they'll stay sad forever. We'll never have to worry about energy again.

We're not gonna let you hurt anyone like that!

Not you OR your little Unversed helpers!

Just try and stop me. You'll see soon enough. I am gonna be a legend around this place.

Now, consider YOUR careers officially over.

What?!

And that goes for the rest of you, too.

Hey!

Where'd he go?

We're in control of this factory now. And I suggested a few improvements--some real doozies I just know you're gonna love. In fact, you're not getting out of here alive.

That weasel means business! He'll never quit.

We have got to get Boo to safety first. Then, we can take care of Randall. Time to find a way out!

Enjoy what's left of your miserable lives.

Why won't you just fail already?!

Hey! What's with the machines? They've gone totally bonkers!

There's no way we can take Boo through here safely.

This must be what Randall meant by


Bad ones!

Nothin' we can't handle!

Yep.

Sulley, maybe you and Mike should take Boo someplace that's safe.

Right.

If you find the contraption controlling those things and smash it, that should do the trick.

Maybe we can use the parts here to avoid the lasers.

I see a machine up there in the cage past the stairs.

Yeah! Let's smash it!

Coast is clear. Go!

Yeah, well, that was just a warm-up. The real fun's just starting!

Surprise, losers!

Look who's starting to sweat.

Great. The power's out again.

Okay! We know what to do.

Gotta find...

Bingo!

Huh?

Uh, Mike? How's that supposed to help?

Heh, that's GOOD!

Yep, take it away!

Nice try, Mikey. I'm not doin' this alone!

Hey! You, not me. C'mon... Sulley!

No. Stop! Sul-ley! Not what I had in miiind!

It's on! Nice work, guys!

It's only a matter of time...

Boo!

Come back! You can't run off, kid!

Kitty!

Oh, there you are.

That paint was kinda growin' on me!

Woo! This is way better.

Agh! Hey, no. Would ya cut that out?

Kitty!

Boo, c'mere.

Sulley, let's get her outta here.

The Heartless are here too?

Face it, you're doomed!

Now it's electric fences?

Start sizzling, boys! This one's got some spark!

Not THIS again?!

We'll take care of it.

Pretty sure the control panel for this place is upstairs.

You chumps ever wonder what microwaved popcorn feels like?

Guess what, losers? I decided to ramp things up a little. This next one's a real whopper.

All right, I'll give you that one. But no more freebies.

Once we get through here, we're clear.

Yup! This is the central control unit for the whole factory! Now whaddaya say we get outta here?

Let me.

I'll do it!

Hey, hey! Show a little finesse!

Rats! Randall must have messed this up. Nothin' works!

We can't get out?

Maybe it would be faster to just break it.

That's brilliant!

Hang on!

Think I've got a better idea. If we can just short it out, the lock will disengage. And, lucky for us, Boo is a walking energy generator.

That might work!

You're our MVP, Boo.

Hide her!

I'm on it.

It's no use. We need a bigger burst of laughter.

Would you care to do the honors?

I'd love to.

40 - 0. Game and set!

I'm not cut out for this racket.

Come on. It's a tennis joke.

Should I've gone with ping-pong?

Nothin' could've saved THAT one.

Wait! Nobody move!

I dropped my contact!

I don't think Boo's gonna get it, Mike.

Do YOU get it?

Yeah, it's 'cause his eye's so big. The joke is you can't lose a contact the size of a dinner plate.

Oh, fine!

Aren't you supposed to be good at this?

I AM once I'm warmed up.

Sora, do the Funny Face Special.

Huh? Whaaat?

Ugh, if you insist.

Everybody join in!

Sora's aimin' for your job.

You boys aren't gonna leave without saying good-bye?

Give it a rest, Randall. You're not gonna get away with this.

We'll stop anything you throw at us.

Yeah!

Maybe you will. Or then again, maybe you won't. I have still got an ace up my sleeve.

Now...I command you to destroy them!

Eh?

Hey. Come on!

Move... Move, you stupid--

Looks like your ace is a joker.

What a pile of junk!

Wha-- Hey!

Just leave him. Don't think he can cause us any more trouble.

Kitty!

Besides, we gotta focus on getting Boo home.

You're right.

Boo's door has to be somewhere in the vault. If we head outside and go through the power station, we can get to the door vault that way.

Follow me!

Oh no...

Disregard Code 835. 72-16 in progress. We have visual on the unidentified life-forms. Suspected cause of the conflagration. Code 72-16, over.

We gotta get to Boo's door.

Yeah.

The whole factory--it's a total mess!

I know, Mikey. But right now, we just have to keep moving.

Ready to descend.

Stand aside. We'll get this fire put out, pronto.

Code 72-16. Unidentified life-form sighted.

These guys are OUR specialty!

We have spotted additional unidentified life-forms.

Thank you! You did great.

Yes, sir. We'll be on our way.

Time to go.

Yeah.

Requesting backup. We need help containing the fire!

Deal with those life-forms!

This way.

Oh, great. This time we're really stuck.

Sulley, have you got any ideas?

Just gimme a second.

Kitty!

If I'm right about that pipe...

Yep, it's perfect. Boo, thank you!

We gotta follow that pipe.

What?! Wait a sec. I thought we were going straight to the door vault. The only place that pipe leads is to the cooling tank!

You sure you don't have a better idea?

Don't worry, Mike. Just trust me.

Kitty!

I'm pretty sure Maintenance hasn't finished patching it up.

This way.

Wait a second... It's the door vault!

Yep. What'd I tell ya?

Sure, nice job, Sull. Seriously, if I didn't know any better...I'd say you actually ran the place.

Thanks, Mikey. All right, it's not much farther.

Hey! What's this black goop?

Gawrsh, it looks like some kinda trail.

Everybody look for Boo's door.

Randall...

Didn't you learn your lesson with that pile-of-junk fiasco?

Oh, I learned a lot.

Wait, Mike. Something's different!

Oh, please. It's just more junk.

An Unversed!

Mike, time to reach down and let the scary out.

Oh, I'm ready, Sulley. I'm ready!

Finally... This is exactly what I need to take over the company. But first, I am getting rid of YOU.

Attack!

Whyyy?!

Ah!

Where are you going--

All right, and in ya go.

There's no place for you here anymore, Randall. Now we're in the business of making children laugh.

You think it's funny?

Hilarious! The more that you whine, the funnier it gets.

Enjoy your extended vacation.

You clowns are gonna be sorry when I find my way back and I finally take over this place!

Mama, that gator's in the house again!

Are you kidding?! Oh, this time, he's in for it. C'mere!

Ugh! Oof! Ahhh!

Get back here!

So long! Smell ya later.

And now we just need to do one last thing.

Hang on! I have a way to lock him out.

And that takes care of that.

Uh-huh.

Okay, Boo. Time to go home. You must be tuckered out, but we'll play together real soon.

What NOW?!

Who are YOU?

Gotta say, that strange facade had me fooled at first, brother.

Wait a sec...

Oh yeah! You were at the cathedral! And hey! Who are YOU to call anyone strange?

Say, do we know this guy?

Uhhh...

We haven't ever met in the flesh. I am Vanitas.

This is the part where you spout some mumbo jumbo and disappear, right?

This whole world...was powered by scream. They converted the screams of human children into energy.

And this very company was what made it all happen. It's as rich a source of negative emotion as we'll ever find.

For the last time, we already stopped doing that!

Did you? Then how do you explain all these canisters of surplus scream?

This facility was everything I could hope for. And I was lucky enough to find a pawn whose heart was darkened by thoughts of revenge.

You mean Randall.

All Randall ever cared about was winning. And this guy took advantage of that weakness.

My heart is made of just one thing. And the Unversed collected enough screams and sadness from those children to reconstruct it.

Yeah, and the whole time they were trashing our company in the process!

But, even with all this negative emotion, my heart is still incomplete. I need something else.

Whoa!

The half of me that sleeps on...inside of your heart.

Vanitas!

Ventus... What a strange place to slither off to...

...you insignificant speck.

What are you talking about?

Oh, you wouldn't remember. When you were little...you formed a special bond, with a boy named Ventus who joined with your heart.

Ven!

Is he sayin' that one of the missing Keyblade wielders is inside Sora's heart?

How is that possible?

Now, you will return Ventus to me.

Donald...Goofy...

The King told us about this. Ventus wasn't able to defeat Vanitas. They struck each other down, and then the King said that Ventus's heart never returned to him!

You're not gonna do that to Sora! No way!

Stay out of this.

Sora!

Join your heart...with mine!

Made you look!

Let me go!

Over here, Sulley!

Close it! Quick!

Boo!

Hey!

That was awesome!

Thank you!

We owe ya.

No, WE should be thanking YOU. We never woulda managed to get Boo this far if you hadn't come along to help.

And finally, we found her door.

Boo, I know how excited you were to come play with Mike and Sulley. Sorry we dragged you into this.

Watch it! You're gonna scare her with that face!

Hey, you are WAY scarier.

Gawrsh, I think you're both scary.

Okay, Boo. Time to go.

Kitty...

We'll catch up soon, kid.

Mike Wazowski!

No, that's Donald, Boo.

Mike Wazowski.

Better. I'll see ya, kid.

Boo!

So looong!

Sorry for all the headaches we caused.

Don't mention it. And actually, it was kinda nice havin' a little adventure for old times' sake.

Yeah, the flying and the falling--and hey, let's not do that paint thing again--but nothin' like running for our lives to get the heart pumping!

I had a great time.

Donald! All you did was complain!

I did not.

Any chance that we can drop by again?

The door's always open.

And maybe Boo can join us!

Yeah.

Bye!

Good-byeee!

For the record, I still get the most laughs!

Happy exterminating!

Thank you!

We should go to the realm of darkness!

No way!

You can't go there until you get the power of waking!

But come on, we have to do something! If we don't act, the Organization's gonna win!

Sora, do you even know how to get to the realm of darkness?

Well, Riku and the King do.

They won't tell you.

Nope, not until you complete your own mission.

Huh?

The King?

Riku?

Is this a bad time?

Ienzo.

So, I have some news about Ansem's Code and the replica we need for Roxas's heart.

Oh!

And...?

First, the replica. Even is still missing, but we found some of his research. I'll see what I can learn from it.

You've got our thanks.

As for Ansem the Wise's data, we've discovered a very interesting passage. I'll read you exactly what he wrote.


Roxas and TWO MORE?

Who else?

Oh. Thanks, Ienzo.

Certainly. Take care.

Three different hearts...

One of them's Roxas. The other one must be Ventus.

You're gonna believe what Vanitas said?

Well, uh...it's kinda all we got to go on.

Sora, do you know who the third one might be?

Uh-uh.

'Cause Sora can't count.

Hey! That's not related.

Donald...

Tell me, will you stay here?

I can't shake the feeling that these waters touch another shore I've visited.

The Destiny Islands.

You've heard of them?

Yes. They are quite lovely--a far cry from this wasteland.

I'm staying. Someone will come for me.

These waters are the in-between of dark and light, its shores the margins of day and night. They brought you and I together, so why not also you and another?

Yes.

Who's there?

You...

Master...I must have a word with you.


? So now you mock me.

Do you recall those experiments of the heart you bade me cease? Among the test subjects was a girl. She had lost her memory, just as I had. But...you can reconstruct memories. You did with Sora. I believe you have seen the girl's memories.

What is your question?

Where did you put the girl?

What girl?

Very well. If you won't tell me here...

I think you should go.

A lost guardian of light?

You wait here...for the King and his fool.

Where's your Keyblade?

Don't need it!

No more! I'll go.

You are wise.

Poor thing. I mustn't leave you with nothing.

What...is this feeling?

Hiya, Sora.

Hey, Dale. What's up?

Chip just got a message from Merlin.

Chip! I got him!

Hey, Chipper!

Hi, Sora!

Hi, Chip. Does Merlin need us for something?

Yep, I think it's got something to do with some kind of book. He said he'll have a cup of tea while he waits for ya.

A cup of tea where?

Oh no! He said tea, but he didn't say where.

Do you mean he left before you could find out?

He's a tough wizard to pin down.

Anyway, message delivered. Bye!

Where could he be having tea?

I don't know.

Say, if you were gonna have a cup of tea, wouldn't you wanna have it at the best restaurant you could find?

Ohh... Of course!

Little Chef's bistro.

Yeah! Let's go drop by Twilight Town, and we can see if Merlin's there.

Ah, greetings, gentlemen. What brings you all the way out here? Besides the finest tea this side of Big Ben, of course.

Huh? But...Merlin, I thought that you asked us to stop by.

Gracious, did I?

Mm-hmm.

Didn't ya leave a message for us with Chip and Dale?

About a book?

Ah! Yes, the book. That's right.

Behold.

Hey, this is...

Sora's not on it.

Did somethin' happen?

Well, that's what you need to find out, lad.

Okay, I'll see you in a bit.

Take care.

Yes, and good luck.

Oh, bother. Think, think, think... Think, think, think...

Pooh Bear!

You okay?

Oh! Hello there, Sora.

You're home.

Uh...huh? Good to see you, Pooh. And you, too, Piglet.

Hello.

You're not in trouble? But I thought something odd must be going on.

Hmm, let me see... I don't remember anything oddish, but perhaps I've forgotten. Think, think, think...

Oh, we've got trouble all right!

Think, think, think... Oh, bother.

Would that be the Rabbit sort of trouble?

S-s-s-sorry, please continue.

Sora!

Wow! Who's this?

It's okay. He's my friend.

Hi, I'm Sora.

And I'm Lumpy! It's nice to meet you!

Sufferin' sassafras! Stomp around a little louder, why don't ya?

Oh! Gopher, I'm sorry.

I kind of like it when the ground gets bouncy.

Well, I suppose if something has to bounce...

Speaking of...

Hmm?

Back for some more bouncin', Sora?

Tigger!

C'mon, let's go! You too, Roo!

Yippee!

Me too! Me too! I wanna bounce!

Think, think, think...

Oh yes, it is time for bouncin'! Say no more! All would-be bouncers are welcome.

Oh, I remember now. Rabbit's trouble is harvest related.

Well, thank YOU for remembering my plight, Pooh. Better late than never.

EXCUSE ME!

Would anyone else care to remember why we're here?

As I recall, we came to help you with your garden, Rabbit. After which, perhaps, you'll invite us in for a smackeral or two of honey?

Correct.

No. No! I mean, we'll see about that, Pooh. Now, the garden, if you please?

You can help, too, Sora.

What? Me too?

What a harvest!

Thanks to Sora's help.

Yes, quite right. Thank you, Sora!

Well, how's about a little more bouncin'?

Oh no, no no no! There's no bouncing in farmwork!

Aww, no bouncin' at all?

Huh?

I want to bounce.

Whippersnappers and their bouncing...

Excuse me, Rabbit. The carrots are very nice, but might you have some honey to go with them?

Now's not the time, Pooh. If I give you any honey here, I'll just end up with a bear stuck in my front door, AGAIN.

Well, looks like your problem's solved. Guess I'll be on my way.

Solved? Oh, it's far from solved. We still need to harvest the fruit!

Won't you stay, Sora, for the sake of honey?

Uh...okay!

Yes! Yes! Look at all this marvelous fruit!

Oh, it's lovely.

Lumpy loves, loves, LOVES fruit.

You know, Rabbit, I find that fruit always tastes better with a little honey.

You're right, Pooh. It certainly does.

Hoo-hoo! Then, I'll keep lookin' for fruit up at bouncin' height!

And I'll search closer to the soil.

Sora...

...could you help me with my flower patch? I've got a surprise for Pooh.

A surprise, for Pooh Bear?

Yes, Sora?

Ohh. It's nothing, Pooh.

Here, Pooh. A pot full of honey. It's your reward for being such a big help. Eat all you want.

Oh, thank you. Rabbit!

You planted all these flowers just for Pooh?

Really? Why?

It's simple, sonny. Flowers mean nectar. Nectar means honeybees. And honeybees...mean honey.

Oh, and the flowers are so lovely. I like the pretty colors.

Look at 'em all. They're bouncin' even higher than me!

Sora, I believe the one I should thank for all that yummy, delicious honey is you.

Don't mention it, Pooh. Besides, we all helped.

Um, Sora?

Hm?

You used to be right here. Why is it that you went away?

Away? Oh, THAT's what you meant by


Yes. You see, when I get a rumbly in my tumbly, it's very hard to think of anything but honey. So I was worried that I might have forgotten you away.

Silly bear, I'd never.

Oh, good, because I want us to be together forever.

Pooh. We are together. There isn't a second that we're not. (thinking to himself) Except I can feel it. Our connection's weaker... Why is that?

What's wrong, Sora?

Oh, it's nothing. What matters is I'll be here from now on.

No going away.

Thank you, Sora.

Splendid. All is as it should be.

But how come Sora's picture disappeared in the first place?

Sora?

Something's happened to me that made me vanish from Pooh's heart.

Merlin, I don't ever want to lose my friends.

Well, now.

Huh?

There's no need to fret, lad. Whatever's lost can be found again. There are always new paths between hearts for us to discover and traverse. But you already know that.

Yeah!

It's cold! Donald, gimme a coat!

The magic doesn't work that way.

Guess he's too used to the beach!

Hey, islander, what can I say?

Look! Even the sea's turning to...ice...

Donald, this isn't YOUR magic, is it?

Uh-uh.

Do ya think it's the Heartless?

Might be. Let's go.

Wow!

That girl... She looked so sad. I wonder what happened. Maybe the Heartless? We should talk to her.

Oh... A dead end.

Naw, Sora can run up this.

Yeah, no problem.

Gawrsh, look how high up we are!

Do I have to? What if we fall?

Hey, hold up!

Why are you here? Where did you come from?

Hi. I'm Sora, and I--

Uh...I'm from...let's just say someplace...a little warmer.

I'm Donald.

And I'm Goofy.

Are you visiting Arendelle? For the coronation?

Huh? Um... uh...

You got us!

So, what's your name?

Elsa... Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

What? The queen?!

You shouldn't be out here. Please go back to the village.

Why? Your Majesty, you look like you could use a friend. Don't you want to talk?

Please leave. I need to be alone. I don't want to hurt anyone.

Oh... Is it that bad? You must've been through a lot.

We know what that's like, don't we?

Sure, adventuring's fun, but it definitely has its ups and downs. When the going gets tough, us friends have to stick together!

Exactly! Although, Donald, you DO lose your temper a lot, so...I can relate to wanting some alone time.

What? I don't do that!

Enough!

Elsa... Did you...

The Heartless!

Don't worry. We got 'em. Take cover!

Elsa, are you okay?

I...I'm sorry I was so upset. Thank you for your help.

Look out!

That's amazing. You can control ice.

Control it? No, all I ever do...is hurt people.

It's okay. Those were just the Heartless.

You said that word before. What are they?

Monsters that are after people's hearts. Wherever they go, there's trouble.

They're after people's hearts?

Yes, they're dangerous! You should head home before it gets any worse.

This is my home now. I can't go back.

I don't want to hurt anyone.

What?

Arendelle is safer with me staying up here.

Not safer for you!

Please, go away!

Elsa...

Aw, don't worry, she'll be okay. Seems like she's pretty strong.

You gotta let her go. She wants to be alone.

Yeah, I hear you...but I just wanted to know why she was so sad.

And how is it any of your business? Read the room, kiddo.

Who are you? That's...the Organization coat. You new?

Excuse me? Oh yeah, you forgot. The name's Larxene. This time, remember. And we'll take care of Elsa, so don't you worry.

Do you--

Nope.

Well, she seems to think she knows us, so maybe we should play along.

Not unless her name's


Excuse me! I'm right here?

Why are you after Elsa?

No one's gonna hurt her? But we're not about to put up with YOUR meddling. Stay here and behave yourselves.

Wait. The ice!

It's going to wall us in!

Ice is so not my style.

Larxene!

Anybody see a way out?

No, not me.

Well, we can't stay in here.

Elsa's in REAL trouble now.

Yeah. Larxene promised not to hurt her, but I trust those guys as far as I can throw 'em.

They've gotta be up to no good!

Clearly!

Start looking.

Yeah, we'll freeze if we don't find a way out.

There's something funny about that pillar.

It's moving!

Hey, look! We can get through now!

More pillars!

That spin trick you did should work again.

Sora, you can climb this!

There might be something up there.

Well, that seemed to lock everything into place.

That better be the end of it.

This must be the exit.

About time.

See her?

I think she mighta gone up in that direction.

Yep.

Okay, c'mon!

More CLIMBING?

Yep. And tough climbing, too.

We can do it. C'mon!

The snow glows white on the mountain tonight, not a footprint to be seen. A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I'm the queen. The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside. Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried.

What?

Don't let them in. Don't let them see.

That's Elsa's voice!

Be the good girl you always have to be. Conceal, don't feel. Don't let them know. Well, now they know.

Let it go! Let it go!

Can't hold it back anymore.

Let it go! Let it go! Turn away and slam the door.

I don't care what they're going to say. Let the storm rage on.

The cold never bothered me anyway.

This way!

It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small.

And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all.

It's time to see what I can do, to test the limits and break through.

No right, no wrong, no rules for me. I'm free!

Let it go! Let it go!

I am one with the wind and sky.

Look at that!

Let it go! Let it go!

You'll never see me cry.

Here I stand and here I'll stay.

Let the storm rage on.

My power flurries through the air into the ground.

My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around.

And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast.

I'm never going back. The past is in the past.

Let it go! Let it go!

And I'll rise like the break of dawn.

Let it go! Let it go!

That perfect girl is gone.

Here I stand in the light of day.

Let the storm rage on!

The cold never bothered me anyway.

Wow. I don't know what we just saw but...wow. That...was Elsa?

She looked different.

And a lot happier, too.

Let's say hi.

PLEASE don't tell me that you're spying on her now.

Larxene!

Don't turn this around on us. YOU'RE following her.

Ooh. Look at YOU get all sassy. Okay, I'll admit Elsa is a person of interest to us. Maybe she's one of the seven pure lights we need--the New Seven Hearts. Gotta make sure though. Fortunately, we're in the best position to tell. Can't pick out that
...unless you're standing in the shadows.

And maybe...Elsa DOESN'T have it. I mean, just look how icy her palace is--made of magic she forced herself to keep hidden until now. What if it's dark magic?

Elsa would never rely on the darkness!

Actually, it's still too early to call. Depends on how SHE sees it. If she believes her magic is darkness, that's what it will become. Accepting her power, whatever it is, is the only way she can set her heart free. So what will Elsa accept? Light or darkness? I know I wanna know!

Well, good for you, but guess what? I won't let her fall to darkness!

It's her choice to make, not yours. You know, I'm starting to understand why she gave you the cold shoulder.

Larxene!

You wanna help her? Then stop trying to be her hero! Let her figure things out her own way!

Donald! Goofy! Are you okay?

Phew. I'm okay...

All good!

I think we should probably go check on Elsa.

And make sure Larxene was wrong about her magic.

Yeah.

But don't you tell her what Larxene said.

Huh? Why not?

Well, to keep the order.

Yeah. Order.

Oh... Okay.

Wait, fellas. Do ya hear that?

Look!

Avalaaaaaanche!

Quick, climb aboard!

Right!

Here we go!

It's closin' in!

I got this!

Incoming! Watch out!

Dodge it!

It's right behind us!

Look who's back!

Phew...

Wow! Look at all the pretty colors. There's blue, and green--ooh, I love green! And look, black.

Just like my buttons. Hmm?

Silly spiky grass. Give me back my foot.

Was that...a snowman?

Huh? Uh...did you see that snowman?

Snowman?

Yeah. And here's the funny thing: he was walking and talking.

Everybody knows snowmen can't walk. You must've imagined it.

Huh... I thought he was real.

Well, maybe we'll see him again. But if we don't get goin', we'll never reach Elsa's palace.

Oh, right! I almost forgot! C'mon!

I can't wait to meet Elsa. I bet she's the nicest, warmest, best person ever.

Wow!

See? I told you! A walking, talking snowman.

Well, whaddaya know? You were right!

I wanna look!

Wow! You really ARE alive! What's making you walk?

Um, well, I guess...my feet.

Hello. Olaf, are these your friends?

Nope! Never met 'em. Don't know anyone blue, green, or who's oddly spiky.


? My hair?

Wait, why don't I get a color too? My name is Sora.

And I'm Donald Duck!

Oh.

And I'd be Goofy the Green!

I'm Anna.

And I know they're strangers, but...they seem pretty nice to me.

I'm Kristoff, and this is Sven.

Nice to meet ya.

So, where are you guys all headed?

We're going to try and put an end to this crazy winter.

And to do that, we need to find my sister, Elsa.

Elsa's...your sister?

What a coincidence. We're going to see her too.

You know Elsa?

Yeah, we ran into her up the mountain. Um... Do you mind telling us what's going on around here? We're worried. We think your sister might be in some trouble.

Trouble? Are you sure?

All right. I know we just met, but...Sora, was it? I get the feeling that you're someone to trust.

I'm right there with ya.

I just hope you like long stories.

Sure.

Ya know, I should go find some moss for Sven. He's looking a little hungry. C'mon, Sven.

Hey, w-w-w-wait, what's going on? Tell me. Is something happening?

C'mon, Olaf. You're with me.

Sure, Sven. Reindeer Sven too?

The reindeer IS Sven.

Oh, how fun!

When we were little, my sister and I used to be really close.

But then, one day, for some reason, Elsa just shut me out.

Do you wanna build a snowman? Come on, let's go and play. I never see you anymore. Come out the door. It's like you've gone away.

Years passed and we barely ever saw each other. Then, finally, it was time for her coronation.

We used to be best buddies and now we're not. I wish you would tell me why.

Let's just say I was more than a little excited. I thought we'd finally have a chance to talk.

Do you wanna build a snowman? It doesn't have to be a snowman.

But at the party, I did something that made her mad. We got into an argument, and I lost my temper.

Go away, Anna.

I was just so frustrated!

Okay, bye...

And then, well...that's when she used her magic to push me away. It was all my fault.

Please, I know you're in there. People are asking where you've been. They say,
and I'm trying to. I'm right out here for you. Just let me in. We only have each other. It's just you and me. What are we gonna do? Do you wanna build a snowman?

I shouldn't have upset her the way I did. Elsa ran away because she was frightened. I have to bring her home.

I'm sure she knows how much you love her.

And I think...maybe that's why she looked so sad.

It's just like when Riku disappeared. He thought he had to push me away, to protect me. Maybe Elsa's the same. (to Anna) If anyone can help her, it's you.

Huh?

Thanks.

Hey, guys! I need some help!

What's the problem?

This.

A stick problem?

It's not a stick. Well, it IS a stick, but it--

It's Olaf's arm. (sigh) He's fallen apart again.

Fallen apart?!

Uh, how come you're not upset?

Oh, it's no big deal. He's a snowman. We'll just...put him back together.

Really?!

You can do that?

I gotta see this! A-hyuck!

The pieces can't be too far from here. Could you guys help us look for 'em?

'Course!

It is kinda hard to spot him in all this snow.

Everything looks like Olaf.

He can't have gone TOO far.

Heeey! I'm over this way!

Huh?

I heard it too.

Yep, that's Olaf's voice.

Would I call this cozy or snug? Mmm, I'm gonna go with snug.

I can hear you! You're getting closer!

His voice is getting louder.

Hi, Sora!

Hey, Olaf. There you are!

I was starting to think nobody'd ever come along and find me.

Well, I'm glad we did.

Are these trees made of ice?

Maybe. Look at the little snow-blossoms growing on 'em.

Why don't we look up above the waterfall?

This...MIGHT be Olaf?

Might be...

There's only one way to find out.

I think I mighta seen Olaf's legs leggin' it.

Where did he go?

Look! Legs!

I caught them!

Yay!

Great job, Sora!

Think that's all of him?

Yup!

Anna'll know what to do next.

Wait, why does everybody look all wobbly?

It's not us, Olaf. You're about to tip over!

Huh? Wha-- Oh no.

Aww...

Yeah, I kinda figured that was wrong.

Is THIS him?

Well, it's the right shape...

But it's huge.

Anna, question... When did you get so small and tiny?

Um, actually, Olaf, it's more that you're really big now.

You're right! What a great view!

Hmm... I think we did it wrong.

Aw, but I like being tall.

Keep looking...

Hey, this is Olaf's body.

It is!

Button and all!

And that should...do it.

You sure something's not missin'?

Nah. Looks right.

Wow, I feel so much better.

Wait! Where's my cute new nose! The one Anna gave me!

Uh, Sora... Do YOU have his nose?

I don't think so.

Nope, didn't see it.

Sven...




You're right, buddy. Thanks for finding it...and not actually eating it. (as Sven)


My nose, it's back! Oh, I love having a nose!

Hey, Kristoff, how'd all this happen, anyway?

You know, I'm not sure. These weird animals--well, they were more like monsters--they just crashed into Olaf.

I knew it.

The Heartless again!

Yeah.

The
? Hmm... And I thought the wolves around here were bad.

Kristoff, look!

They're back!

No... I've already fallen apart today.

We know how to handle them! Anna, Kristoff, keep going!

Okay!

Wait? What?

We better catch up!

Yeah!

I'm getting cold.

Just keep moving. You'll warm up!

Gee, nothin' ever gets you down, huh, Sora?

All right! I love snow!

So much for
Sora.

We're back! Finally.

That palace is incredible!

Yeah. I wonder if Anna and the others made it there yet.

You kind of set off an eternal winter...everywhere.

Everywhere?

Well, it's okay. You can just unfreeze it.

No, I can't. I don't know how.

Sure you can. I know you can.

Anna and the others must've gone inside.

I CAN'T!

Sora?

Are ya hurt?

No, I'm fine. But...I think something terrible must have happened.

I hope our friends are okay.

What?

Stop! Put us down!

Go away!

Heads up!

Watch out for my butt!

Hey! It is not nice to throw people!

Whoa-whoa-whoa, feisty-pants.

Let me go!

Okay, relax. Just calm down. Calm down.

Okay! All right! I'm okay.

Just let the snowman be.

I'm calm.

Great.

Huh? Oh, come on!

Aw, see? Now you made him mad.

I'll distract him. You guys go!

No, no. Not you guys!

This just got a whole lot harder.

We can buy you some time!

Wait for me!

Huh? Where's Goofy?

Hey, Sora! I got an idea!

Goofy, what are you doing?

Oh! That's perfect!

Huh? Hey!

Get ready... Okay, now!

Oh, yeah!

He's not done...

Bring it, snowball!

Wh...what?

Good thing snow's so soft. We could do this a HUNDRED times.

No! Let's not.

A-hyuck! Ya sure you don't wanna go again?

Nooo thank youuu!

Do you think everybody else made it?

I don't think the snow monster got 'em.

They probably went back to the palace.

Makes sense. For us, too. We still need to talk to Elsa.

Second time's the charm!

Yeah, back to the ice palace.

Hey...that's Elsa. But who's that guy?

It could be somebody from Arendelle who came up here to help her.

Don't think so. That doesn't look like help to me.

Oh no!

Darkness?

Let's move!

Him again?!

Hey! You'd better not have hurt our friends!

Huh?

Elsaaa!

Hey, wait up! Are you...looking for Elsa, too?

Whoa! Eeeasy! Do you wanna save her from the bad guy? We're on the same side.

Elsa...

I guess all he ever wanted to do was keep Elsa safe.

Hey. We should team up, big guy.

Team up?!

C'mon. We wanna help her, too. Why not?

So, whaddaya say?

Sora!

One great thing about Sora--he can always make friends with anybody.

Yippee...

Donald! Goofy! C'mon.

Wait for us!

Stop it. Put me down!

That's Kristoff.

Do me a favor and wait here. If you come alone, Kristoff might freak out.

No, Sven! We're not going back. She's with her true love.

Kristoff!

Sora.

You all right?

Yeah, I'm fine. I'm glad you guys are safe.

Hey!

Where'd Anna go?

She's back at home.

Something happen?

Anna was struck in the heart by Elsa's ice magic. If the ice isn't removed, she'll freeze forever. Only an act of true love can thaw a frozen heart. So I took her back to Arendelle and her true love, Hans.

But...what about you?

What ABOUT me?

Uh, I sorta assumed you guys were...

Nooo! I just keep her from getting lost.

Really? Oh, but you seem so...

Perfect together!

Yeah, like me and Daisy!

What?

Anna.

Elsa...

Is that where Elsa is?

Elsa and Anna might both need our help. Let's go!

Storm's getting worse.

I'm freezing...

Yeah, and the wind's just makin' it colder!

We got to get out of this storm!

There must be some place we can use as shelter.

Look! He's protectin' us from the storm!

We can make it!

Okay, guys. The storm's died down.

Gawrsh, I hope Anna and Elsa are okay.

Hurry!

Kristoff?

Anna!

Elsa?

Elsa, Anna...

Nooo!

Anna...

What?!

Do ya really think this will help Anna?

I don't know...but we'd better try something!

Let's get it.

Together!

Come on!

What?

So, love has filled BOTH their hearts with light.

Larxene!

Two in one world... Definitely didn't see THAT coming.

First Marluxia, now you. What is this all about?!

Oh, I see, so you bumped into Marluxia. (annoyed) Then why am I explaining this again? I told you before: The New Seven Hearts. If you mess up and don't find your seven guardians of light, we're gonna need another group to fall back on.

Leave innocent people out of it!

Ohh, look at this tough guy. Such a big boy now. Well, maybe you should do your job, and find the other guardians of light.

Please, like you've found your thirteen. The King said you're one seeker of darkness short.

Oh no, we're set.

Huh?

They have all thirteen? Then if we don't find our seven, they'll go after Elsa and Anna.

It'll be okay. They're strong.

And now, it's our turn!

You're right. They have each other.

Anna...

Oh, Elsa.

You sacrificed yourself for me?

I love you.




Love...will thaw. (to Anna) Love...

Elsa?

Of course. Love!

Yes!

Sorry we're late.

It's okay. You got here as fast as you could.

The Organization claims to HAVE their thirteen darknesses.

Do we believe it's true?

Umm...I don't know, but there's something else they keep mentioning. They're after a
which seems to be code for


Well, as the original princesses of hearts' time for protecting the pure light has ended, they have passed the light to others. Our enemy must certainly be cognizant of this. If the
is what they wish to call them, so be it.

But Kairi hasn't passed on her power. Is she one of the new seven?

She must be. But still, she chose to wield a Keyblade and fight with us as one of the guardians of light.

Yeah...

We haven't found Terra yet.

Hey, at least we've tracked down Ventus. Vanitas told us that he's inside Sora's heart.

And so did Ansem the Wise in his data, so it almost certainly must be true.

That's great! Now we can rescue Ven.

Maybe, except Aqua's the only one who knows where he's hidden. We still have to find her first.

I'll go.

What?!

Is that wise?

You need the power of waking, Sora. Do you have it?

Uh...no? Probably not.

Without that power, you are not ready to face the realm of darkness.

C'mon...

What's so funny?

Sorry. Master Yen Sid knows you a little too well. He said you'd try to stage a half-baked rescue.

Yeah! Laugh it up!

Sora, I know you're volunterring because you're worried--about me and Mickey.

Yeah...

Well, thanks. But, the power of waking's important. You can come to the rescue once you've got that. Sound fair?

Yeah. All right. But be safe. No reckless stunts.

Yes, sir.

Sora's the reckless one.

No, not exactly. He just doesn't think.

If only he listened to Master Yen Sid the way he listens to Riku. That would be a good start.

I'm listening now.

Very good. Sora will continue his journey to build his powers, while Mickey and Riku will focus on the search for Aqua.

Yes, sir!

So, why are you back?

Nice way to greet your old partner in crime.

So, why do you think the old geezer took us back? He must know we backstabbed the Organization when Xemnas was running it.

Xehanort doesn't care about you or me. To him, we're nothing but empty husks. The old Organization was the same. Xehanort needs thirteen vessels to hold his essence.

Husks? Not me. You up for another coup?

Oh, please. You couldn't do it last time. You gotta play it smart, like me.

What?! You're not smart!

Well, you heard what Marly said. I don't have to be smart.

Or capable, or likeable, or attractive. A cereal bowl would make a better vessel.

Whoa now, you are WAY out of line. I am extremely imposing...when I want to be. Which is, admittedly, almost never.

Why haven't you gone to any worlds? Are you slacking?

'Course not. I got benched.

Huh?

Saïx brought Vexen on board. They must be planning to use replicas.

Those windup toys?

Oh, no. The replicas are way more real than you remember. I mean, one stole my spot!

OF COURSE it stole your spot. You're dumb as a brick.

Har-dee-har.

Vexen's latest replicas are no mere puppets. The Riku replica we used in Castle Oblivion was just a prototype. The next replica, the one crafted from Sora's memories, was real enough to join our ranks. And Vexen claims the new ones will be human in every way. If he ever finishes them.

Oh... The thing is...I kinda told Sora and his nitwits that we're ready. My bad.

Let them believe as much.

Ugh. Xemnas.

If they think that we have all thirteen darknesses, then they will panic. And panic leads to a lack of preparation.

Yeah, totally.

Why is this thing a member again?

Hey now! Pointing is rude.

The first six members of the original Organization were all apprentices to Ansem the Wise, and the seventh and eighth members joined thereafter. The thirteenth member was Roxas, a Keyblade wielder. So. What about you? How do you suppose I chose numbers nine through twelve?

Because our hearts are über powerful.

Wrong. You have been brought together for another purpose.

What? So that we can rot away on the bottom rung?

You're in too? What is this, Organization Rehash?

I happen to play an important role. No one
me.

You were listening? So not cool.

One must hold one's cards as long as necessary.

What
? That stupid box that Xigbar claims is real, but won't tell us a thing about?

You'll just have to ask Xigbar that.

Now then, Xemnas, what is this
? You didn't invite us back for old times' sake.

You four are going to reveal your greatest secret: the ancient Keyblade legacy that slumbers within you.

Me business is boomin! Splendid! Just splendid! You two have outdone yourselves. The critics are going cuckoo and the register,
. I canna wait to see what it is you cook up next.

Nor can the customers.

We try! Right, Little Chef?

Yo ho, yo ho, a pirates life for me

Why are you so happy?

'Cause we get to be pirates again!

Yep, you always did like this world.

How could anyone not? Still...it's a real shame we don't have a bigger ship.

Got any idea where we're going?

Where else? The edge of the world!

Captain Sora!

What ails ya, Mister Goofy?

The edge of the world!

Aye!

We're runnin' outta sea, sir!

Aye! We're runnin' outta sea.

Running OUT?!

Hard to starboard!

But there's no time, Captain!

Where'd we end up THIS TIME?

We've been walkin' forever.

I'm exhausted...

Some pirates. We won't get anywhere without a ship.

A ship...

Sora... This is dry land.

Oh boy!

It IS a ship!

Hail, Sora!

Huh? (excited) Jack Sparrow!

CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow.

Sure is!

Hey, Jack. Where are we?

Belay that. Ship absconding!

Huh?

Help me catch the Pearl before she gets away!

Aye, aye, Captain!

Heartless?

We better get rid of 'em quick.

Who's shooting at us?

Cease fire! Cease fire!

That's who's doing this.

No one said you could use my ship!

Jack!

Mister Gibbs.

Aye, Cap'n.

I thought so. I expect you're able to account for your actions, then.

Sir?

There's been a perpetual and virulent lack of discipline upon my vessel--why?

Sir, you're... You're in Davy Jones' Locker, Cap'n.

Davy Jones' Locker?

I know that. I know where I am. And don't think I don't.

I'm in Davy Jones' Locker. Assuredly.

Jack Sparrow.

Barbossa!

Ah, Hector! It's been too long. Hasn't it?

Aye, Isla de Muerta, remember? You shot me.

No, I didn't.

Sora. We meet again.

It's lovely to see you all.

Oh! Will. Elizabeth. Is...something about you different?

Yeah, you look all swashbuckly.

Well, I've seen some adventures. But I never thought I'd find YOU here.

Speaking of... Where exactly IS
? What's all this about a locker?

Davy Jones' Locker. Jack neglected to repay a certain debt to Jones. So Jones sent the Kracken to devour Jack, and that's how he ended up here.

Then...Davy Jones' Locker... (frightened) You're saying that we've gone beyond...

Beyond the grave?

And we're here to wrest Jack from his fate.

Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?

You add an agreeable sense of the macabre to any delirium.

He thinks we're a hallucination.

Heh... Complete with these three masqueraders.

Jack, this is real. We're here. We've come to rescue you!

Have you, now? That's very kind of you. But it would seem that as I possess a ship and you don't, you're the ones in need of rescuing. And I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.

Jack, Cutler Beckett has the heart of Davy Jones. He controls the Flying Dutchman.

He's taking over the seas.

And him must be stopped. The Brethren Court is called.

Leave you people alone for just a minute and look what happens. Everything's gone to pot!

I'm lost. What's going on?

Well, umm...sounds to me like this Beckett fella they mentioned is tryin' to conquer the ocean.

Oh.

The sea belongs to everyone!

Yeah! No conquerers.

Yeah!

Listen, Jack. The world needs you back somethin' fierce.

And you need a crew.

Why should I sail with any of you? Four of you have tried to annihilate me.

Jack, WE'RE on your side.

Aye, so you are, mates. I never could have caught the Pearl without you. Sora, Donald, Goofy, you're hired.

Yes!

Now, as for the rest of you...

Tia Dalma, you're in. Gibbs, you can come.

Weigh anchor, all hands! Prepare to make sail!

Jack...

Which way you goin', Jack?

Right then, Mister Sora. The helm is yours, provided...you pass muster.

Huh?

See that island there with the two peaks? Prove you can reach that, and the open sea is yours.

Oh!

Aye, aye!

So, we DO have a destination, right?

I can't tell anymore.

Jack is just making it up.

Cast your fate with Jack Sparrow, and you soon be sharing in the wrath of Davy Jones.

The guy Will mentioned? Who does he think he is, anyway? And what did Jack ever do to him?

Truly? You don't know who Davy Jones be? And you say you be men of the sea?

Let's put it this way--we're from ANOTHER sea.

Are you now? Jack and Davy Jones' fate be intertwined. Jones, him raised Jack's precious Pearl from the depths and make Jack captain for thirteen years. In exchange, Jack promise to give Jones him soul as payment. But thirteen years pass, and Jack fail to return.

So Jones, him send the Kraken to devour Jack, taking him and the Pearl back to the depths. But... if Jones learn that Witty Jack cheat that fate, him wanna punish Jack even worse. And Jack's friends, too.

Are you, um, talking about us?

Ya mean that the Kraken's gonna eat us?

Aw, let the Kraken have a crack. I ain't scared!

Hmm... Not scared at all? That be rare. Most men, them run for land at the mention of the Kraken. Not you.

But Jack be scared. He want to be free of his debt to Davy Jones. That's why him need the box.

Box?!

It be a chest...where Davy Jones lock away the part of him that hurt. The pain it cause him was too much to live with...but not enough to cause him to die.

And...what part of him is that?

Him heart.

Oh, how does he do it? A creature absent a heart and yet somehow able to keep existing... Not even my finest replica can claim that achievement. The secret must be in that box. I have to know what mysteries it contains.

I believe our orders were to find the box and seize it. No more. Put a leash on that runaway curiosity.

Always so shortsighted. Why would the Organization seek me out just as soon as I was recompleted--if not to affirm my intellectual prowess and invest in my research? Every stride I make is a stride for all of us.

Oh really? And what exactly are we striding towards?

Luxord, do I detect...a hint of treachery in your words?

What? Don't be absurd. But to be clear, I serve the Organization. I don't share your need to please Xemnas. He's good at wrapping you around his little finger--always has been.

All I desire is the freedom to continue my research. Ansem the Wise refused to nurture my talents. So I cast my lot with Xemnas--with Xehanort, rather. Simple as that.

I see. And you don't care how he uses your research?

Not in the slightest. All that concerns me is that I complete the perfect human vessel.

That's all well and good. But I know this world better than you. Kindly stay out of the way.

Oh, of course. Considering those pests have shown up, I'd hardly get anything done.

I already know what to do with the
Then you can resume your stuffy studies.

Ah, that's my boy. I'll be watching from the shadows, then.

Thanks, Jack. You could've warned us.

Yeah, everything went topsy-turvy and upsy-downsy!

Well, at least we're back in the land of the living.

Thank goodness!

Never fear. All according to plan.

But that be no reason to rest easy.

A ship!

I've never seen one like that.

Heartless!

Look out!

Barbossa, have you allied with those fiends again?

Don't impugn me honor. Why would I conspire with them?

But you DID conspire with them.

Could you discuss it later?

Huh?

Get ready!

Hmm... I sure do wish we could get a little closer.

What? Walk on air? We can't do that!

We can!

Sora!

Donald and Goofy, protect the ship! I'll handle the Heartless.

Taaake...THIS!

All right!

Wha-- Wait! Oh noooooo!

Sora?

Sora?

Sora!

Donald? Goofy?

Where are the others?

After you fell, we came looking for ya. I guess they musta kept goin'.

That's desertion.

Oh... And I was so happy that we got to see them again.

That eager to sail under Captain Jack Sparrow?

Jack!

Perhaps you'll consider an arrangement. One which requires nothing from you but information.

Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.

In exchange for fair compensation...

Square my debt with Jones...

Guarantee my freedom...

Of course. It's just good business.

Were I in a divulgatory mood, what then might I divulge?

Everything. Where are they meeting? What are their plans?

Shall we?

Shall we what?

Some pirate! Won't get anywhere without a ship.

So, let's go get one.

Yes!

Sora and Jack sure are cut from the same cloth.

They even talk alike!

Use that key to free me, Sora, and you have my most certain promise--all the power on the sea you ever wish for be yours.

Free her how?

Sora?

What's wrong?

Huh?

Oh, nothing, really. I'm good.

Look! Something's glowin'.

And there's a chest!

That seems suspiciously convenient.

I'll check it out.

Sora, this could be dangerous.

But Donald! No pirate worth his salt ignores treasure.

Oh, cool.

Woo-hoo! It's our very own ship!

Are you certain about that?

Jack?

Finder's keepers.

How'd he get here so fast?

Mine. Savvy?

No savvy!

Jack, you already have the Black Pearl.

Aye, to which this ship holds no candle. But, take what you can, mate.

Now then, my ship has a captain, but it does appear I'm in need of a crew.

Suppose you'll have to do. Don't dawdle. Climb aboard!

Ummm...

Ready now, helmsman?

Ready enough, Cap'n, but...aren't we kinda...trapped?

Now, Sora, I know you've made passage through straits far more dire than this. Just follow your heart's command.

Make way!

That ship...

It's the Heartless.

But look. This time there's somebody aboard.

Isn't that...

Not the merry company I'd hoped for.

Parley!

A black coat.

Of course...

You back in the Organization?

Yes. Surprising, isn't it, that they'd do me the honor? Never count your cards until they've all been dealt.

Jack, don't you give this creep the time of day.

Yeah!

Come now, are you really so unsophisticated that you'd decline a gentlemanly conversation?

What'd you say?!

Sora. Stand down. It's the Code. Mustn't strike a pirate aboard ship... when said pirate offers to confabulate.

Ah yes. And how could I love games and contests without honoring the rules? Because only by winning fairly does victory have any savor at all.

But...of course the Code is actually more guidelines than rules. Speak your piece.

I am looking...for a box. A chest, perhaps.

You know the one?

Yes. M-maybe. No! I know of A box. But said box is not a box you want to trifle with, mate. Trust me.

Really? A wager, then.

And of what nature would this wager be?

What say we have a little race to that charming port town which you hold so dear?

Port Royal?

Yes. Whoever reaches it first is the victor. And the stakes: you tell me all about that chest.

Against what?

I will get you whatever it is you want.

Done!

Jack!

Then we have an accord.

Now, let us begin!

All hands! Prepare to make sail!

But Jack!

Drop canvas!

Hey... Jack!

With a will, lads!

Jack, listen!

What?!

You can't let him get his hands on that box. Do you really know whatever it is that he's looking for?

Let's just say...there's a potential possibility he wants the chest containing Davy Jones' heart. But I haven't the foggiest notion why he'd covet the blighted thing.

Is it a BLACK box?

It is more black than blue... So, yes!

Hmm... Do you think it's the one?

Could be.

And winnin' the race would keep it out of Organization XIII's hands.

Hey... You're right!

What are you three muttering on about?

Basically, we need to win this race.

Precisely. No purchase, no pay. You might have the makings of a pirate after all.

Yeah!

First one to Port Royal wins!

And I say we make it interesting. Let's try out those cannons.

That's it. Don't let up now!

Go, go go!

Getting close!

Lookouts, report!

Starboard side, all clear!

Port, too!

We got this one in the bag.

The game isn't over until it's over.

Fire!

They're closing in! Come about! Make ready to return fire!

Aye, aye!

Prepare to board!

Another game it is, then.

Magnificent! I salute you all, gentlemen.

You're up to something.

Admit it!

Perish the thought. I know when I've been outdone.

You were outdone before you even started, mate. But I admire your conciliatory way of conceding defeat.

Yes... Now, I believe I owe you your prize. But I neglected to ask what it is that you want. Perhaps...you'll enlighten me?

Aye, that's easy. I want the chest that's aboard the Dutchman.

No, Jack, don't tell him!

Really?

Not good?

Oh, Jaaack...

Well...I didn't tell him WHICH Dutchman.

You tricked him!

Actually, I outwitted him.

You knew he'd tell you where it was!

I've always been far more interested in the long game. Now, let's see where it takes us. That is, if you stay apace.

Huh?

After him!

Nay. There's no point.

Why not?

The ship's listing near to scuppers from that cannon fire. She'll be needing repairs. Best make berth at Port Royal.

Whaaat?

Look for crabs. They'll set her right.

Crabs? Why crabs?

Never mind the particulars, mate. The white crabs. Savvy?

Aye, aye.

Aye, that's all of 'em. Now, to my final task. Be back in a trice.

There, mates. Fit to sail any sea. Now, Sora, one final inquiry: is there any particular reason you wanted this ship?

Yeah, to explore the seas, free as the wind.

Good answer. You ARE a pirate... Captain Sora.

But, Jack...why do you keep saying
like you're leaving?

Ah... It's because THIS me has run his course, mate.


you?

Aye, the surrogate me that the goddess of the sea sent here to help you lot. Of course, any me is still me. I may be duplicatable, but I'm always incomparable. The sea, she smiles upon us, Sora--and let's leave it at that, shall we? For now, the REAL me has a crucial engagement...at Shipwreck Cove, where the Pirate Brethren will meet Beckett and his lot in battle to win back our freedom.

Then let us help.

No, it's for pirates to resolve. But not you, Sora.

You're as free as the winds now, and far you'll go.

So, Jack was showin' us the way.

Even if he did get tricked.

Jack... He said it was the pirates' battle to fight.

But a fight for pirates...

...is a fight for us!

C'mon! Let's find the real Jack!

You made a deal with me, Jack, to deliver the pirates. And here they are. Don't be bashful. Step up. Claim your reward.

Sparrow. Your debt to me is still to be satisfied. One hundred years in servitude aboard the Dutchman. As a start.

That debt was paid, mate.

You escaped.

I propose an exchange.

Will leaves with us...and you can take Jack.

Done.

Undone.

Done.

Jack's one of the nine Pirate Lords. You have no right.

King.

As you command, your nibs.

Scurvy blackguard!

Easy there, mate. You wouldn't want to damage the leverage, now would you?

Now...

Advise your Brethren. You can fight, and all of you will die. Or you can not fight, in which case only most of you will die.

We will fight. And YOU will die.

Look at those clouds!

That must be Shipwreck Cove, the place that Jack told us about.

The water looks turbulent in that direction.

Luxord!

Ahh, you do know how to make good time. Yes, one must simply marvel at your celerity. But, such compulsive behavior is eventually going to bring you nothing but sorrow.

Lost him again.

How are we gonna go after him?

First, get those Heartless!

Right!

He's plotting to swipe the chest in the heat of battle.

To Shipwreck Cove!

Fast!

Guys! Are you okay?

Sora... You're a welcome sight!

We've all been quite worried about you.

Isn't that...?

Sora?

Where's Jack? And Tia Dalma?

I'm afraid you've missed a few things while you've been gone.

Jack... He's...he's been taken by Cutler Beckett.

Yes, and Beckett commands Davy Jones and the Flying Dutchman.

Barbossa thought we could defeat them if we released Calypso, the goddess of the sea, who was really Tia Dalma, bound in human form.

But it didn't work.

Aye, a fickle goddess Calypso be.

So what now?

Nothin'. Our final hope has failed us.

Use that key to free me, Sora, and you have my most certain promise--all the power on the sea you ever wish for be yours.

So...Tia Dalma was Calypso. She's the one who was helping us.

And you know what? I think...that she might just be able to help us again.

You can't give up now. We can all fight, together.

The sea belongs to everyone!

I said that. Don't copy my expressions!

Huh? You did?

Sometimes it just goes in one ear and right out the other.

Wait... Really?

Yes!

It's not over. There's still hope for us.

You will listen to me. (shouting) Listen!

The Brethren will still be looking here to us, to the Black Pearl, to lead. And they will see free men and freedom! Our enemy will see the flash of our cannons and hear the ring of our swords, and they will see the courage of our hearts as we succeed and they fail. Gentlemen... Hoist the colours!

Hoist the colours!

Hoise the colours!

Hooray!

Oh boy!

I knew it was you!

So that's the Flying Dutchman.

The chest Jack told you about has the heart of Davy Jones in it. There's no way it's the chest that you're looking for!

No one knows what's in the chest we're looking for. If it's a black box, then we are to collect it, simple as that.

You don't know what's in it? Then why do you need it? How will you know you've found it?

Got me. Regrettably, the higher-ups haven't deigned to tell us. But they did say the box contains


Huh?

That's all you'll get from me.

Hmm, it's far to chaotic to find the box like this. Perhaps I'll remove that ship from the picture.

Now, this should afford me time to look.

THEY'RE looking for hope?

Hey!

Will and the others need us!

Yeah, I know!

So, you got what you want. Perhaps you're the better player among us. However, I must demand you give THAT to me.

Pardon? You must be mistaken, mate. I'll not be giving you anything.

Then I invoke the right of parle--

Uhp, no! No parley.

Look around. We're a little busy.

And besides, I've already got all that I want, mate.

Yup. Still works.

Jack Sparrow... Are you lost? Prisoners don't belong on deck. Your station is in the brig!

We're here!

Tables have turned, mate.

Hardly. Just a few more maggots to join my crew!

Over here!

Hahah! Fish food!

Care to surrender?

The chest. Hand it over!

Jack!

Stay out of this, boy!

Harridan! You'll see no mercy from me.

That's why I brought this!

Missed. Did you forget? I am a heartless wretch!

Ah. Love. A dreadful bond. And yet, so easily severed.

That's not true!

I may still have a lot to learn about love, but I know what it means to share my heart with others. And it will take more than you to break a bond like that.

What does a whelp like you know about the heart?

The whelp has seen far more of the world than you know.

Ha! What of it?

Tell me, William Turner do you fear death?

Do you?

How disappointing. So this is all they meant when they said
We've been chasing the wrong box this whole time.

Heady tonic, holding life and death in the palm of one's hand.

You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.

Cruel is a matter of perspective.

Is it?

Will? Will? Look at me. Look at me!

You will not forestall my judgment!

She's taking us down! Make quick, or it's the Locker for us all!

Jack, can't we save him?

Part of the ship, part of the crew. The Dutchman must have a captain.

Elizabeth, say good-bye.

No! I won't leave you!

Thank goodness, Jack. The armada's still out there. The Endeavour's coming up hard to starboard. And I think it's time we embrace that oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

Never actually been one for tradition.

In we go!

It's nothing personal, Jack. It's just good business.

Ready on the guns.

Full canvas!

Aye! Full canvas!

Fire!

Fiiire!

Fire!

Fiiiiiire!

Fire aaall!

It's just...good business.

We did it!

The Flying Dutchman must have a captain. Just wed, and now she and Cap'n Turner must live in different worlds.

One day ashore, ten years at sea. It's a steep price.

Will...

Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.

Mrs. Turner.

Elizabeth...

Take care.

Jack...

Thank you.

One day isn't enough time.

There's always enough time for hearts to say what's true. Sora, you know better than anyone. It only takes a moment to connect with your mates... With your hearties.

There's always enough time. And I'm going to find them.

Hey, Axel!

Hey. Liking the look.

Cut your hair, too.

Mm-hmm. So, you gonna try yours on?

Uhh...I dunno. Maybe later.

But you always wear the same thing.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it. This is how you pick me out of a crowd. I make myself easy to remember.

How thoughtful.

Nah, not really...

Our training's almost finished.

Yeah...

Somewhere inside me is Naminé. If we can free Roxas, we can free her too.

I guess so.

Naminé was made when Sora freed me from his heart. So, now that she's a part of me again, I figured all was right. But she can't look at this forest, feel the wind on her face, none of it. And if she could, it would be different for her. Her time was short, but she lived it, and that makes it hers. What right did I have to take those feelings and experiences back? They don't belong to me. Nothing's as it should be. Not for her OR Roxas.

I know.

Way back when I was a kid, I met this other weird kid. Somehow we became fast friends. Never saw him again--nearly forgot about him, too. Then, I met Roxas. Couldn't believe it. The two of 'em were identical. Oh, I didn't tell Roxas. Didn't want HIM to go vanishing on me, too.

The kid's name was Ventus. He's one of the lost Keyblade wielders we're looking for. Think he's still got ME memorized?

Oh yeah. Very memorized.

Now that we're going back, I'm worried about everything.

Well, you don't have to worry alone anymore, Axel.

Riku, look!

Riku!

Mickey!

It's about time!

Heeey, shut it! C'mon.

What now?

Please. I have created enough victims.

Yes, you have. All the children sacrificed in the name of your research... So make things right.

I told you I did not take her. Her disappearance was why I put a stop to the research.

And that makes you honorable? You used Roxas and Naminé and threw them away. I doubt there's a merciful bone in your body. You took the girl, and hid her. Now, show me the data you are hiding here.

Roxas and Naminé... If there is any reason that I still draw breath, it is to atone for what I did to them.

He said


Yeah.

That man needs us.

Right.

Yeah.

If you do find the girl, what is it that you expect will happen?

The child's memory holds a mystery to unravel--one concerning the battle we seek between light and darkness. You know something and that... is why you stopped the experiments.

You are completely deluded, Xehanort.

We shall soon see.

Yoo-hoo!

'Scuse meee!

Who are you?

Oh, well, I'm looking for a friend who used to live here.

No one lives here. Begone.

But sir...

No, no, no! Not one more step. Get out!

This way!

Hey, loser!

...or not!

Hayner!

The squiggly things?

They...protected me.

Hayner! Get a move on!

Oh... Okay.

I serve the Organization. This is treason.

I see what is happening. Have it your way then.

Are you guys okay?

Yeah, I think.

Nobody knows the twists and turns of Twilight Town better than us.

You are Roxas's friends.

That's right. So you know him, too?

Oh yes. Quite well.

Pay dirt. Guess it was worth staking out the old mansion after all, because this guy here is what I call a lead.

That's the only proof we have that Roxas was our friend.

Tell us about him. We wanna know him better.

My dear master. You are safe.

Who's there?

Even, is that you? So...those Nobodies were your doing.

I have been waiting for this. Gave up a normal life in order to plant myself in the Organization. And when I heard Xehanort had gone looking for you, I realized it was my chance to find you as well. For you see, I, too, wish to atone.

Oh, wow!

Cool!

C'mon, let's go!

Aww, but I wanna take a look at the big city!

Yeah, it does seem pretty exciting.

I feel so metropolitan! Uh, cosmopolitan?

Not-apolitan!

Ooh!

Now what?

I gotta tell Riku what a blast this place is.

But we just got here. We haven't even done anything yet.

Blast? I'll show you a blast!

The Heartless!

C'mon!

Go Go! You okay?

What in...

Go Go.

Baymax!

Go Go's suit has shielded her from a major injury, but the blow she sustained to her head has caused a mild concussion. We should take caution and not move her until we can fully stabilize her head.

Got it.

Oh, cool! That's a robot!

Hello. I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.

Wow, cool! This rules!

Uh, Sora. Remember our other problem?

The Heartless.

Whoops! Oh yeah!

Hey! Who are you?

Oh. (turning) I'm Sora.

Donald.

And I'm Goofy.

Name's Hiro. You...mind helping us fight those things? Our team's called Big Hero 6.

Sure!

Let's go, Baymax!

Sora! Go from car to car!

Look above you!

Look!

It tried to crush us!

You may reduce the risk of injury, by seeking cover.

Not cool.

People like spectacle, not truth.

Yeah, who needs quality reporting when you can just make stuff up?

I don't get it. I mean, didn't they see how awesome we were?! Sure, those things landed a couple of good hits, but we had chem-balls, and laser hands, and fire-breathing!

Well, it really didn't matter. They beat us.

Where'd they come from?

Well... Why don't we ask the guys...who actually stopped 'em?

Hiro, you never introduced us.

Oh, right.

Well, uh, this is...the gang!

That's Go Go.

He's Wasabi.

How ya doin'?

And that's Honey Lemon.

Hello there.

Wha--?!

I'm Fred. Don't be alarmed.

This is not my real body.

Good. For a second, I thought this was the monster w--

Those three are Sora, Donald, and Goofy, the, uh...

Keyblade Hero 3!

I am detecting minute contractions in your faces and shoulders, perhaps due to the garage's brisk temperature.

To remedy that, I will give each of you a hug and warm you with my internal heat source.

Hey, why did you say THAT?!

Sora, you know Donald and I don't have Keyblades.

So? Are we heroes, or aren't we?

Not here, we're not.

The monsters. Tell us how you managed to take them down.

They're called the Heartless, and they're drawn to the darkness inside people's hearts.

Ooh, now we're talking! Light versus darkness. Classic conflict!

Would you calm down, Fred? This is serious.

Very serious. We don't have any way to fight them.

Wait. So we're just gonna give up?

With our current skillset, my analysis places our chances at 0.0000--

Yup, we get it, Baymax.

Hey, don't sweat it. The three of us will go take care of the Heartless for you. Right, Donald, Goofy?

Wait. We're going too.

It's okay. We've got it.

We have to help. My brother would have.

Great, buuut...don't we need a plan?

We train up! When heroes are brought low, they get new powers.

It's shugyo time!

Did you read that in Geek's Quarterly?

Fred's actually not wrong. I may have an idea.


?

Yeah. Cool, huh? It creates a CG overlay that augments your vision. While you wear it, this device sees everything you do and logs it.

Uh, huh...

You put it on your face.

Heartless! Donald!! Goofy!!!

Are you okay?

There's no Heartless here.

Huh? But...uh...

Whoa! Chill. Sora. Just take the AR device off.

Wow, I have no idea how you're doing it, but this is cool!

Thanks. But so far the map data only covers San Fransokyo. I need to expand it.

Now can we shugyo?

Not yet, Fred. He's still learning.

Sora, all you need to do is run through some courses that Hiro scripted. Like a minigame.

We'll put a tracer on your movements so we can--

Shugyo, shugyo, shugyo!

So we can shugyo.

I guess shugyo's like training. That's a good idea. We could prob'ly use the practice.

Speak for yourself.

I can shugyo by installing new combat data.

Huh?

Hey. Let's just try it out.

Okay, guys. Go through the rings and head for the goal.

Okay!

I'll be here to help you out remotely.

Start with the rings right in front of you. Head toward the indicator on your AR device. Try and stay on course. If you start to veer off, you'll know. I put up a virtual boundary.

Ya gotta keep up, Sora!

Jump side to side and go through the rings. You got this!

This is awesome!

Come on... Can't we do this on the ground?

Whoa!

Okay, I didn't program this. But, you can handle it. Just improvise.

Climb up the side of that building. And watch out for enemy fire.

Don't you just LOVE chemistry?

Sora, time to fly. Go full superhero!

You are near the goal.

Interesting. Gravity--not binding.

Hey, wait. My laser hands...

...can be projectiles!

Ooh! Change the weapon, change the attack.

Whoa. A freeze attack!

Fire...and ice. Diametrically opposed...or SO WE THOUGHT!

Thanks, Sora. That should be enough data. And I think you sparked some new ideas.

Yeah! Hiro, I think there's a way to--

Hey, are you listening?

That...should do it.

We interrupt your scheduled program to deliver this breaking news. Moments ago, the city's South District was attacked by numerous unidentified creatures.

Witnesses describe losing sight of victims during the mayhem. Many also said they saw strange, floating heart symbols in the vicinity of the missing victims. City police are urging citizens to stay at home. For those just joining us, only minutes ago the South District was attacked by--

Go time.

Heartless!

Sora, above you!

I'm picking up some kind of threat.

Okay, I'll check it out.

Run up the buildings if you have to. Watch out for those enemies on the building.

Piece of cake.

Wait, Sora! Something big's coming your way.

Gotcha! I'll take care of it.

That thing's massive! Stop it, or it's gonna wreck the city!

The target's moved up onto one of the buildings. You gotta go after it. I marked the target so you don't lose track of it.

Just try and catch me.

I've got an idea!

Hey!

I can't aim if I can't see!

Better?

Much better.

Freeze!

Whuh? Oh, I get it...

It's a combo move!

Nice, Baymax!

What?

Now, we fist bump.

Fist bump?

To display excitement. Hiro taught it to me.

So, like...this?

Bah-la-la-la-la-la-la.

Bah-la-la-la-la-la-la?

Get ready!

Another one?!

We're here!

Ugh! Can't we pick on one our own size?

It looks the right size to me.

Watch me scorch 'em with my freeze-nado! The only tornado made of ice AND fire.

You took on the wrong court magician.

And the wrong captain of the guard.

Prepare to face Keyblade Hero 3!

Oh, come on...

And the crime fighting team of Big Hero 6! Together, we're unstoppable.

Yeah!

Was that awesome...or was that TOTALLY AWESOME?! Haha! Jumping!

Yeah, I was pretty good.

Your magic is amazing. Do you think I could study it sometime?

Why not?

You just made Donald's day.

My brother wanted to help people. Now, we try to do the same.

Your brother?

Yeah, Tadashi. There was a fire, and now he's gone.

But he always wanted to make a difference. He cared about people. That's why he worked so hard to create Baymax.

I'm sorry.

He's still here. In Baymax. In all of us.

Tadashi--he lives on in your hearts.

Yeah. Right. He will always be a part of us in some way.

And when you're not strong enough, he'll make up the difference.

Sora. You okay?

Yeah. Fine.

I'm with you.

What?!

What's that?

Great, they're back.

Oh, we got this.

Time for a lesson.

Cheee-aaarge!

Wait! Uh, guys! That one's not like the others!

It can't be. Microbots?

Microbots? You know what they are?

Well, they're different from Heartless.

Uh-huh.

Microbots are designed to do whatever you think via a neural transmitter...that communicates what you're...

They're kind of a mini-bot I invented. Some bad stuff happened and I thought that meant they were totally gone. But those enemies are way too similar. Which means someone's controlling them. The question is who.

Could it be?

I'm gonna go back to the garage and look into it some more. You mind going after 'em?

Sure!

You bet!

Of course!

We need you on the sciency stuff.

Baymax... Stick with 'em.

All right, Hiro.

Sora, Donald, Goofy, I will be your personal healthcare companion.

Thanks, Baymax. We're in good hands. C'mon, let's move!

Sora, I just marked the target's position. Look for the indicator.

Target acquired.

They're not microbots... Be careful!

It's no fair! Why can't we hurt it?

Magic is no good.

What do we do?

This is weird.

Sora, you guys all right?

Oh... Yeah, but the target escaped. Have you got any leads?

Tons. Somewhere inside that thing, there is a core. It's what powers the whole cluster. The core is the only way to hurt it.

Now he tells us.

Wasabi! What happened?

Let's just say it's a handful.

Team, check in.

So far, so good.

Guys, I'm really tired of just dodging this thing.

Freddit getting frustrated!

Guys, I'm on my way.

No, Hiro!

Hiro, you analyze the Darkubes.

Wait, did you just say
?

Yeah. They're dark, they're cubes. I call 'em like I see 'em. Every bad baddie needs a cool name.

Yeah, that's not cool.

We'll gather as much data from the Darkubes as we can.

Hiro, figure out a way for us to beat this thing!

But guys, I can't leave you out there all alone.

Hiro. We are a team. And teams delegate. We need you at the garage. We trust you, so you trust us.

Fine. I'll look for a way that we can expose the Darkubes' core. Just keep that data coming.

Copy.

Hiro, what should WE do?

You protect the others.

I'll mark their position for you on your AR display.

We got it!

Time to go, Baymax!

All right.

Sora, the Darkubes are gonna be tricky to bust open. You'll have to assess everyone's situation and--

Improvise! I know.

Cool. Good luck!

Honey Lemon!

Hey, Sora? I think I'm stuck. See if you can find the residue from my chem-balls. If you hit it with fire or electricity, it might trigger a chain reaction!

Gracias, Sora! Next time I won't go so easy on them.

Honey Lemon! I'm glad you're safe.

Wasabi! Can you hear me?

Sora! Am I glad to see you! I am not a big fan of heights. Hey, you think it dragged me up here 'cause it's scared of being attacked from above? See if you can get the drop on it.

Finally! Thanks for the save, Sora. I'll see if anyone else needs help.

Wasabi, good to see you're all right.

Go Go! Are you in there?

Sora! I don't know how to stop this thing. I tried slowing it down with my discs.

You see anything big you can smash against it?

Hey... What about that big red thing from the shugyo?

Sora! C'mon, hurry!

Thanks. I owe ya.

Doesn't look like you're hurt, Go Go.

Fred! You okay?

I'm getting pulled in too many directions! Do you think you can free my arms and legs? Gotta find a weak point and loosen the Darkubes' grip!

Yeah!

Super juuump!

Pure appreciation, my man.

My citizens! They need me!

Glad you're okay, Fred. Listen, Sora! The Darkubes have converged on a single location.

Whatever's happening can't be good. I'm almost done pinpointing the core. If you need me to help--

Nah, it's okay, Hiro. We're on it.

Thanks.

Get a move on!

Okay, there's a lot of them.

What do ya suppose they'll do?

I don't think we wanna find out.

I say we destroy this thing!

Yeah!

But without a strategy, we'd just be wasting our strength.

If we knew where to strike...

Sora! I got it! I'm sending you an AR software update. It'll show you where the core is--the Darkubes' weak point. I'm coming to help.

Huh? That's weird. Is it busted?

Hiro, who's that on the display?

That's not the display. He's really here.

Huh?

The black coat... He's back?

Are you done messing around?

What? Wait, that voice...

Hold on. You...know this guy?

And now...enter the supervillain.

He definitely has the vibe.

Funny.

Riku... But...

As if this stupid experiment wasn't already a hassle.

Huh? Where'd he get that?

Hiro, do you recognize it?

Yeah...

Not quite ready.

That's the first chip I made for Baymax. It's full of combat programs.

Programs?

Yeah, they tell Baymax how to react.

Does that mean...it's like his heart?

Kind of...

More then!

Riku!

Oh no!

Sora, I'm on my way. I'll look after my team. You guys fight the Darkubes! Remember to use the AR device to target the core!

I got it!

Baymax! Full thrust!

Go, Baymax!

Full speed!

Baymax...

Oh, this isn't for you.

At least not until we're done.

Riku... Is it you? Why do you look like that?

Looks are deceiving, but the heart? You know that it's me.

I know Riku wouldn't do this. Not without a good reason.

A reason? When did that ever matter? We've been trying to one-up each other since we were kids.

What...?

Don't listen to him, Sora!

The coat means he's with Organization XIII! And THAT means he's not really Riku.

Smarter than you look.

We defeated Ansem and Xehanort--every last one of 'em. But still they all came back anyway, right? So, maybe this Riku
too, from the time when Ansem possessed him.

Yeah, from the past!

What? How?

Unlike a certain wizard you know, I had to play by the rules to travel through time. Which meant leaving my body behind.

I know about this...

But...YOU HAVE a body.

Xehanort's heart left his body in order to voyage back through time. He needed to tell his younger self of the great plans he had in store. There in the past, his heart stayed, and waited out the years until you and I came along. Xehanort's heart possessed me and became Ansem, the first adversary you faced. The rest of him, the piece he left behind, took the name Xemnas and created the first Organization. It was all a part of a larger plan to bring Xehanort into contact with the right hearts--enough of them to form the real Organization XIII. They could come from anywhere, any WHEN...just as long as he had the right vessels at hand to place their hearts in.

Vessels?

Replicas!

That's right. The Replica Program was a success. We are as real as people.

Then pack up and leave! What are you still doing here?

To see if we can recreate a heart from data.

What?

Sorry, did we steal your idea? That walking balloon over there has a


At least that's the nonsense I'm supposed to believe.

There are hearts all around us. You only have to see them for them to become real.

Where'd you get that? That's my chip. I made it.

Oh, well, I'm sorry about that. But I promise I'll put it right back where I found it.

What do you mean?

I think I'll be getting back to work now.

No!

Wait!

We gotta stop him. Guys--

You are all suffering from acute exhaustion. I recommend rest.

Yeah, you're right. Let's regroup.

C'mon, guys. What's with all the long faces?

Did you forget that we WON?!

Fred. Not now.

His name is Riku? And you know him?

Yeah... Well, I know A


That one is a fake!

The fake one's with Organization XIII, our arch-nemenies.

Okay, but how'd he get Hiro's chip?

And what did he mean about an experiment?

And what do they want?

He said they're trying to recreate a heart from data, but I don't know what they REALLY want. None of us do. These guys, they show up--and instead of fighting fair and square, they go for the heart and say things to try and get under your skin. They're cowards. And now, they're doing it to you, too. It's our fault.

No. This could be good. That chip might finally be able to give me some answers.

You said that you made it, right?

Yeah. This Baymax--he's actually the second model. Uh, no offense.

I am a robot. I cannot be offended.

It's a long story. But the first Baymax and the chip I made...vanished into another dimension along with the microbots. The chip's back... So the first Baymax might be back too.

Hiro...

Those who suffer a loss require support from friends and loved ones.

What was that?

I don't know.

Guys, c'mon!

Team, let's go!

Why are you snooping around?

That would be none of your concern.

Overstep, and darkness will consume you again.

What an interesting thing to say. I shall do anything I please. As should you.

Oh, I intend to.

Who's he? Friend of yours?

Yes. Though I could not tell you from


Hope it's learned some new tricks.

Yeah, now it's gotta face ALL of us.

That's right.

Freddie want to destroy!

Our probability of success is--

You don't have to crunch the numbers, Baymax.

It's not the sum of our parts. It's the sum of our hearts.

Yeah.

Which adds up to what?

Show me.

Almost there.

What?!

This pile of junk collected the data we needed... The terror of being attacked without warning... The despair of having no place to run... The longing for vengeance...

A heart's more than that!

It's working together.

Smiling at something funny.

Trusting friends.

In every heart, there's hope.

Yeah!

You're right.

Huh...?

That's why I made sure our creation fought YOU. Now the data contains a complete heart.

A heart made from conflict? That can't be real.

What was it you said? I only have to see it for it to become real? So, let's see it.

First, we need a vessel.

What's going on?

Another Darkube form?

Doesn't look as bad as the last one.

It could be a trick.

Usually is.

We can stop it!

Yeah.

Wait! That's...Baymax.

What?!

No way.

Baymax...

Don't bother. This puppet has lost his heart. He won't wake up.

He's not a puppet! Baymax, he's like my family. Please! Give me back my friend.

Yes... I did promise I'd put this back where I found it.

But there's one piece missing. Sora, you're the one who's going to complete this heart.

Yeah, right.

You can't have a heart without sadness...without loss. You see, you're going to destroy Hiro's friend right in front of him.

Wait!

Hiro!

Oh no.

Hiro...

Hiro, tell us. What should we do?

Baymax means everything to me. But that chip isn't who he is.

I already made this mistake once before. Tadashi wouldn't want there to be a Baymax that hurts people. Sora, he has to be stopped.

Okay. Help Go Go and the others. You can leave this guy to us.

Thank you.

Oh no!

Sora, take Baymax!

Okay! Baymax!

I am ready, Sora.

What?

We'll stop him together!

Understood.

Knife Hand. Roundhouse. Hammer Fist.

Guys... Hiro...

So...did we stop him?

Safety mode kicks in if he's put under too much stress, so he's probably just in stasis.

We'll have to destroy the chip if we want to be certain.

But...are you sure?

Yeah, dude...you don't need to go THAT FAR.

Maybe we can find another way.

It's the right thing to do.

Tadashi would've done the same thing.

But Hiro...isn't that Baymax's heart?

It's okay. Baymax is HERE.

I...should be the one.

Ow?

Hello, I am Baymax, your personal healthcare companion.

Two Baymaxes!

This is great, Hiro!

Yeah, thanks.

So, uh, do you think I could take one of them with me?

Uh, that's a no.

What? Come on.

No. Who's gonna repair him?

One. Just one of them!

C'mon. Pleeease?

He's MY personal healthcare companion?

Hey, Little Chef, your bistro turned out to be a big hit!

Yeah, everybody in the whole town loves it.

Good idea, Uncle Scrooge.

Aye, naturally! But to be perfectly honest, I'm actually a wee bit surprised myself.

Gawrsh, Uncle Scrooge, I thought you had this all planned out in advance.

Wait, didn't you?

Oh, I had the business side of it planned down to the finest detail--the open air theatre, the flyers, the promo data--the whole kit and caboodle. But that wasn't enough. It was Little Chef's commitment to his craft--his desire to put smiles on everyone's faces--that made the bistro a success. A heart that cares that much is like a giant magnet that grabs ya and pulls ya right in.

That must be why we like hangin' around Sora. Don'tcha think so, Donald?

Yeah!

Aye, and perhaps why Little Chef took such a shinin' to you in the first place.

Folks are hungry for connection, so you lads keep 'em well fed.

Sure thing! Right, Little Chef?

Sora, somebody's callin' us on the Gummiphone.

We got baaad news.

Huh?

We totally lost contact with the King and Riku! They're all on their own in the realm of darkness!

Whaaat?!

See? I knew I shoulda gone!

Chip, how do we get to 'em?

NOW we can ask?

It's not like we can use that big old door anymore. It's completely gone.

Yeah, we closed it after beating Ansem.

And we certainly can't ask the King or Riku.

'Cause you wouldn't LET me ask.

Only King Mickey can open a door to the realm of darkness.

Huh?

It's because he has a special Keyblade of darkness. He figured out how to make it open the way.

Oh...

Gawrsh, what'll we do then?

May my heart be our guiding key. It'll show us the way.

A gate!

But where does it lead?

It doesn't matter! Go!

Hurry, Sora!

Okay.

Why do you think that gate took us here?

A Keyblade?

It looks so old.

How did it end up here?

Hmm, maybe it's another guiding key.

Sure, but to guide us where?

A door!

Let's go.

Not you guys.

Huh?

The realm of darkness--it isn't safe for you.

Forget it. I'm going.

Yeah. You can't make a whole pint without us.

Come on, guys, think about it. Even the King and Riku struggled in the realm of darkness. Someone needs to stay out here, just in case. If something happens to the rest of us, you two need to carry on.

Sora... (angrily) Stop it!

We understand, but we don't want you goin' someplace dangerous on your own.

Thanks, guys. But I'll be fine. I'll make sure Riku and the King are safe. Trust me.

You promise to be good?

And come home nice and safe?

Right.

Riku, look!

Riku!

Mickey!

This Keyblade...

Is it her?

Mickey...

You're too late.

Aqua?

What happened?

You abandoned me, that's what. Left me in this shadow prison for more than a decade, knowing what it would do to me...

I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

I reached this shore after endless wandering. Waited forever for help to arrive. But no one ever came.

I lost my Keyblade. Had no means of fighting my way back through the Heartless. You should have known I was stranded. Do you have any idea how lonely it is here?

How frightening it is to have no one?

All that's left in my heart is misery and despair...and now, you can share it!

There's no need. Got my own.

Enough!

Sora...

I made it!

How, Sora?

I...had a little help. Watch over the King. I've got this.

Okay.

Shouldn't have abandoned me...

I've wandered the shadows endlessly...

You don't know what true loneliness is...

I've waited for so long...

Now you can share in the terror I've felt!

So...this is the end.

Aqua!

Sora...

Aqua!

Aqua!

Ven... Terra...

Aqua!

Aqua!

It's you...

Thank goodness. You're awake!

Mickey...

Are these...the Destiny Islands?

That's right.

When did they fall to darkness?

You're in the realm of light.

You're home.

You're home!

Welcome home.

We did it!

WHAAA--?!

Quiet, you dunce!

But, dude, why would you pick me?

I cannot let the chosen catch wind of this, understand?

Oh, I see! It's because I got benched!

I got
too!

Wha--

Hey! Quiet!

Okay, man, look. Real talk? Backstabbing those guys would be stupid. If they find out, we are yesterday's toast. I mean, what's in it for me?

Forgiveness.

Huh? For what?

Men like us--in the pursuit of science, we sometimes make terrible mistakes. Lose sight of our mission to help people. But now I can help someone with my research. Now, I can atone.

I'm not a scientist.

Wait, wait, wait!

C'mon, dude. I'm useless, I'm chicken, we're not friends. I can count the number of times you and I have hung out on one hand--LESS than one hand! I didn't even KNOW you in the old life!

Fine, FINE! But listen.

Huh? No way!

It's true. The whole thing was HIS idea.

Huh? No stinkin' way.

He wants to atone too. But, he is one of the chosen, so his hands are tied. Hence my actions on his behalf, hence my need for you to act on MY behalf should all go awry. As you said, we are far from friends. No one would ever suspect you.

Hmm... So I'm not doing any fighting?

Correct. And more importantly, no benchwarming.

Ha! Yeah baby! Sign me up.

Yes! Demyx time.

We've come a long way toward reconstructing Roxas's heart. But a vessel... Without that... Yeah, right. Bodies don't grow on trees, Ienzo. It's the backup plan or nothing now. But...the backup plan isn't a true solution.

Finally. 'Bout time.

Ooh. Nice place.

Demyx? Is that you?!

Hey, Zexion! Long time!

How's humanity treatin' ya? I rejoined the Nobodies, but, like...I just can't shake the feeling I've been sweet-talked, y'know?

We have sooo got to have a chat.

Whoa, back up. What?

Oh! Sorry, sorry. I'm gettin' ahead of myself. I'm actually here on a top secret mission. Apparently I'm so off everyone's radar, that I'm just the guy to handle a special delivery.

Ta-daaah!

Master Ansem!

Ah, well me, little Ienzo.

They told me you'd gone mad. That you abandoned us. I was just a boy, but I should have known better. I am truly, deeply sorry.

I think what matters is that you recognize the mistake. Peace, Ienzo.

It was I who was consumed by hatred--who failed you in my obligations as your mentor. Forgive me.

So, uh...are we cool to get on with things here?

Got ya a present from Vexen. One was all he could manage for the time being, but hey, he figured you guys would know what to do with it.

A vessel!

You sure about this, Aqua?

If you want, we can take you back to Master Yen Sid's tower to rest with Riku and the King?

Uh-huh.

Thank you. But...Ven's expecting me. I promised to wake him. Said I'd be right back, but I'm not even close. I'm in for an earful.

Ready?

Ven.

I'm sorry it took so long.

Ven, wake up. Open your eyes, please!

Why? Your heart never found its way home?

That was a neat trick.

No wonder no one could find him.

Vanitas!

Why are you here?

Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt your touching reunion, but surely you won't begrudge me a moment with my brother?

What?!

So Venty-Wenty wants to keep sleeping. What am I ever going to do with you?

Shut up!

You better settle down there,


Aqua, I'll handle him!

No. I'M ending this.

But...you haven't recovered yet.

Sorry, but you've seen me too weak, too often. Now it's my turn to shine.

Aqua!

Aqua!

I...have to wake up...

Yes. Tell me what to do.

The power of waking...

I can't. I still don't have it yet.

You never lost it... It sleeps...until someone needs it... Call to it...

I am calling...with all my heart.

Thank you for always keeping me safe, Sora...

Aqua!

Three guardians is more than I care to face. But now that my brother is awake...I'm just certain that he'll come to visit.

Aqua, are you all right?

Yes. I'm fine, Sora.

Huh?! You're...Sora?

Yup. Hey, Ventus.

I get it. You were my second chance.

Huh?

Call me Ven.

Good morning, Ven.

Good morning, Aqua.

At last, we are all assembled. First Sora, Riku, Donald, Goofy, Mickey, I cannot thank you enough for what you have done. And you, Aqua and Ventus: we are fortunate to have you back.

Thanks. I only wish we could have returned to help sooner. We're grateful to all of you for rescuing us.

Thank you.

I feel bad for letting you guys down. We tried, but we still haven't found Terra.

Don't. He studied with Master Eraqus, just like us. He's our responsibility.

Mickey told me that you saved me in the realm of darkness. I should have gone to help you right away. But I was too inexperienced. I'm sorry. I know that I let you down.

No, just the opposite.

Did ya know Riku's a true Keyblade Master now?

That's wonderful.

The King, too.

Good for you!

But Sora needs work.

Yeah, rub it in...

I'm happy to see that you haven't changed one bit.

Huh?

Sora, you probably don't remember...

Umm... Uhhhhhh...

It's okay.

Ah yes. Let us not forget our new Keyblade wielders. Lea, Kairi, you have made tremendous strides.

Hey there. And that's
--

Kairi?

Incredible! It IS you.

You know her?

When you and I first met in Radiant Garden, the Unversed tried to attack a little girl. Do you remember?

Oh, gosh! That little girl was Kairi?

I guess it must've worked--the spell that I cast on you.

I'm sorry. Those days are hazy for me. But it sounds like I'd have been in trouble without you. So, thank you.

Please. You were really, very little. Anyone would forget, hazy memory or not.

This is all very touching, guys, but where do I fit in? Ven looks just like Roxas--or is it Roxas looks just like Ven?

And now I have to explain all of that to him--which is in itself a crazy long story--and, apparently everybody already knows everyone, and this is an insane amount to get memorized!

Sorry, Lea.

You remember me?

Yeah, 'course! We're friends. I can't believe you became a Keyblade wielder just like me.

Yeah.

Axel, you know Ven?

Axel? Who's Axel?

See, see, SEE? Major brain-ache.

NOW who?

Not to worry, folks. To help us out, I've given each of you a Gummiphone. They've got summaries of everything that's happened so far. That way, you can read up, if you'd like. And if anyone has any questions, we can call each other.

That's our Jiminy.

He's always prepared.

Mm-hmm.

Welp, we've got our seven guardians.

Yeah. But...I do wish that Roxas, and Naminé, and Terra could be here with us too.

Since when do you mope, Sora? Come on. Terra's gotta be with the Organization. Which means we'll have a chance to save him.

Leave it to Ven and I. We'll bring him home.

Yeah, I made Terra a promise. I said I'd be there for him when he needs me.

And I'll figure Roxas out. Don't know how, but...I'll get him back.

Naminé is right here, safe with me.

I know that we'll find a way to help her. Trust me--I'm not giving up.

Kairi's right. We're all in this together, Sora.

And Donald and I are no Keyblade wielders, but we'll always be right there to help keep ya steady. We've got your back, not just now, but always.

Three half-pints make a whole!

That again?

It is a shame that all of our friends could not be here. But our seven guardians of light have united. Perhaps you might say that we have nine guardians, with Donald and Goofy. Given time, I know the others will soon stand with us.

Yeah.

Today, you recuperate. On the morrow, you journey to the fated place.

Right!

Yeah!

The stars here are so beautiful. I noticed it when we arrived.

Yes.

We've gone without this for so long.

I know.

I remember dreaming a lot. Of you and Terra. Of Sora and his friends too, I think. And there were some more people I didn't recognize. Oh, and I saw these weird animal creatures! It's like...I've been part of some big adventure.

I've been places, too. But pretty soon...things'll be back to normal.

Let's share stories when Terra's back.

Yeah.

I've had it with this stupid treasure hunt. Every box we've found has been nothin' but a bust.

I agree. Our search ends today.

What-a-huh-now?!

You cannot find the unfindable. The box does not exist.

I KNEW they was takin' us for a ride.

Silence, imbecile. I mean the box does not exist NOW.

Is that some kinda riddle? Just where we s'posed to be lookin'?

Light and darkness are fated to clash. A Keyblade War is upon us. We need only wait for that destined moment. No matter the victors, the box will be revealed.

That's it?! But when's MY big moment?

You will have it soon enough. Once I possess the box, our real work can begin.

Well, Roxas... I shoulda been there for you by now, but here we are.

Shouldn't you say good-bye to your REAL home?

Why...

I'm not here to fight. Relax.

Hey!

You can't eat all this. Why did you buy three of them? One for Roxas...

...and two for good luck?

I dunno. Because I felt like it, okay? Why are you here?

Got it memorized? Back when we were still friends, we used to sneak into the castle.

Yeah...

And we made a friend there, a girl. We apprenticed to Ansem the Wise to rescue her.

Yeah, and we failed. One day she was just gone!

You gave up.

I did not give up. One day we're apprentices, the next Ansem the Wise has up and vanished, the day after we're Nobodies, day after that we're doing icky jobs for Xemnas. I couldn't keep up with you.

Following Xehanort's Nobody was the only way to discover what happened to her. She was his lab rat.

So? You found her? I helped you rise up the ranks, so I hope it paid off.

I'm afraid not. Nary a trace. I started to wonder if we'd imagined her. Maybe she never existed. And then, in time, I awakened to a new purpose. I realized I could be stronger.

Well, then, you blew it! Wise up already and just quit.

Face it. Roxas is just like our other friend.

Gone forever. You need to accept that.

You wish. I'm getting her back. All of 'em!

Especially Roxas! I'm even dragging YOU home.

The marks under your eyes. They're gone.

Yeah. Don't need 'em.

Always told you they'd stop you from crying. The upside down tears.

Would you get lost? I'll clobber you tomorrow.

I expect no less.

How long have you known that I was with you?

You DID save me.

I think you came along for a reason.

I didn't make much of myself as a replica. I was a failure, and after you and Sora moved on, my body fell to ruin and the darkness took my broken mind. I was all ready to give up and let it happen, and then you showed up.

You took that as a sign?

Maybe. I'd rather face my end with you than in darkness.

That's...what you want?

Yeah. But I'm not done yet. Got one last thing to see through.

Take the time you need.

Hey, why's Riku all alone?

He said he needed time to himself. Let's let him be.

Here.

Huh?

Tomorrow's fight will be our toughest yet. I want to be a part of your life no matter what. That's all.

Kairi, I'll keep you safe.

Let ME keep YOU safe.

It's time. The Keyblade Graveyard is up ahead.

Someone's coming.

Legend has it that darkness once covered the world. We know so little about the Keyblade War--only that it was just the beginning. If ruin brings about creation, what, then, would another Keyblade War bring? When the darkness falls, will we be found worthy of the precious light the legend speaks of?

Or will all of creation be instead returned to the shadows? Today, we will recreate the legend and see.

But first... Your light shines far too brightly. It must be extinguished in order for the truth to be seen.

Only when your hopes have been broken by battle upon battle can the key be claimed to Kingdom Hearts.

And break you is what we shall do. It has been etched.

Look at how many there are!

Okay, gang. Get ready!

Everybody else has gone on ahead.

We gotta move!

Is everybody okay?

C'mon, let's go.

Terra!

Ven!

Terra! We found you!

Terra, please say you're in there.

What gives, Aqua?

I know that you're not him.

Now, let our friend go!

He IS their thirteenth.

Today is the day you all lose.

What?!

Before you even face the thirteen, every last one of you will be torn heart from body. But fear not.

The Chi-blade will still be forged.

We're not gonna lose to you.

Ven!

That's it!

Axel!

No! Sora!

Donald, don't!

Zettaflare!

Ven...

This can't be real.

Pull it together, Sora! We haven't lost them. They still have their hearts. But we have to protect them.

Right!

We stand together.

Mickey, Kairi, Goofy, watch the others.

No, we should all get to safety, while we still can.

It's too late for that.

It can't be... No...

Aqua!

Sora!

They're gone. Kairi, Donald... Goofy, the King... Gone forever.

What do we do?

Without them...I... All my strength came from them. They gave me all of it. Alone, I'm worthless.

We've lost... It's over.

Sora, you don't believe that. I know you don't.

Checkmate.

And so darkness prevails, and light expires. You need a new strategy.

My move, isn't it?

Huh?

It's not over.

C'mon. That's not fair. I know I had you.

Yes, you nearly did. But, a game's no fun if you know where it's going. There's more to light than meets the eye. I told you.

Some light comes from the past.

Where am I?

Can't stay away, now, can you?

Hello?

The name's Chirithy. And this is The Final World.

I'm Sora. What's the...
?

There's nothing else beyond this. You've wandered here more than once before on your visits to the Station of Awakening, buuut...I let that slide. The edges of sleep and death touch, and one can't help the occasional crossover.

Wait,
?

Yes. The natural end for those whose hearts and bodies perish together. But some persist, and arrive here.

My heart and body perished? Um, does that mean...

Something is holding you here--refusing to let you go. You're hanging by a thread.

What about my friends?

I'm afraid that no one else arrived with you. And if they're not here, they're either gone forever, or they're clinging to the world you came from.

I'm going back!

Whoa, whoa! How exactly?

You can't just wander out like your other visits.

What?

I told you. The other times you came here by your own choice. This time is very different. To become your old self again and return to the real world, you'll have to piece yourself back together in this world first.

Agh! Why am I in pieces?!

What? No, not literally, of course. You're conceptually in pieces. On the inside, who knows, but on the outside you're just fine.

Oh, okay. You kinda freaked me out there!

Oh boy...

Usually, only a heart can reach The Final World. But since you've clearly managed to retain some kind of form, that can only mean your body was cast into this world as well.

Okay, so...then if I can find my body, that means I'll be able to go back?

Precisely. But there's a lot of you to find. You're going to be busy.

These must be pieces of me.

Hello?

Good day.

Oh cool! You can talk.

You look like a person. How is it that you retain your appearance? Are you special?

Umm... I'm a little hazy on the details.

As are we all.

So whose heart are you?

No one's anymore. They took away my name--everything about me.

No way. They couldn't have taken away your heart.

Only because it pines for another.

Yeah? Someone's coming for you?

I cannot be certain. He's been changed beyond recognition--his heart replaced with another's. But, were he to regain his old self again, he would be distressed by my absence. So I choose to wait here, where he can find me.

Good. You have to believe.

Believe? Oh, you mean know in my heart he will return? Without any proof?

Exactly, BELIEVE. I thought it was all over for me, but a friend of mine looked me in the eye and said,


So, uh...who did this to you? Heartless steal hearts, so...a Nobody?

A...somebody.

Really? Hmm... Well, I wish I could help...but my situation's no better.

You must see to the tasks before you first.

The tasks before me? (chuckles) There's so many.

All the more reason for you to make an effort.

Yeah. You're right. I just wish I knew what to do.

Here you are on the brink, and yet you hold on to who you are. You possess a strong sense of purpose. And in that purpose you will find direction.

Thank you. I'm really glad we met. You cheer me up. I hope that friend of yours finds you soon.

Thank you. Me too.

Oh, hey. If I see him, I'll tell him that you're here. What's his name?

Huh?

Our secret.

I found myself here, lighter than before. Unburdened. All my pain and responsibility, gone. But something in this new ease keeps catching at the corners of my mind. Is it all right for me to be here like this? There is a faint memory. A sound. Others may have found it grating, but it warmed my heart. That crying... I have to find it. Embrace it. The sweet weight I carried. My dear, beloved burden.

Whoever said love and hate are two sides of the same coin is a liar. The second our eyes would meet, we were at each others' throats, every time. The idea of us as friends is laughable. I'm finally my own here, and what a relief! Just...not as big a relief as I'd thought. It's weird. Something's just...missing. Ugh, is that how this works? Did I keep going back for another fight just so we could spend the time together? Maybe it's not as simple as
or
The heart's a complex thing. Wonder if he feels this lonely, too... Takes two to have a fight, after all.

We were always together. Practically joined at the hip. We'd wear the same clothes, eat the same food, go the same places. We were an identical pair--like walking alongside a mirror. So why is it just me here now? There's this...this feeling. Calling to me. Pulling at me. And now I share it. Feel it as my own. We are always together.


I had thought those words would make him happy, but it was sorrow that clouded his face. I had shared all I know, my every technique. What more did he seek from me? I never heard the answer. Time passed on, and...here we are. But now, since we've parted, I think I understand. He wanted the same thing I did. This wasn't just about passing on knowledge. It was a communion. A connecting of hearts.

I kept telling everyone we were just friends, but he crept into my head. Into my heart. It started to feel weird being together. I stepped back, and he never stepped in to close the distance. I wonder how he saw it. Wonder how he feels. ...What's this emotion, filling me? It's over- powering. It's him. I have to respond. I have to tell him how I really feel.

Did I matter? What I ever there at all? I thought I'd found my place, surrounded by people I trusted. But look there. I'm gone, yet they go on meeting up just the same. Hm? The table's set wrong. There are too many glasses... Oh. Added a new member, have they? That didn't take long. That was my seat. That was MY place at the table. Their glasses clink against the newcomer's, one after the next. No, this is not my place. Maybe it never was.

We spent so many years together. A lifetime. It wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, of course. We had our share of troubles. Sorrows, too. But all of it is dear to me now, every minute we had. We got to experience so much. I have no regrets. At least, that's what I thought. Special occasions may stand out, but there's nothing so precious as the quiet days between them. That's what a life is, really...

I was defeated. That was supposed to be it. I'd just...fade away. Yet a part of me remains. But why? I have no regrets. No reason to cling to this life. I turn these questions over in my head again and again, and again and again I remember. Our clash. The feeling of exhilaration. Of pleasure. I can see his face clearly in my mind. He wore the same grin as mine. I would dearly love to cross blades with him again...

After long years of service, my one regret is that I must pass on before my master. I suspect he will not notice my absense. I doubt he so much as knew my name. Yet how, then, can I explain this sight? The artworks that I was tasked with tending now bear a thin layer of dust. It seems he expressly commanded that none of the remaining staff take up my work. What can that mean, save that he saw me not as one among many, but as an individual? That he feels my absence. Grieves for me. I am awash with gratitude at the thought of it. I must do all that I can to reciprocate... Star 11: Oh, good. If you're speaking to me, I suppose I must exist. I feel a consciousness, or memories, perhaps. Feelings. They pass through my mind one after the next, but none of it feels real. And that was fine. I'd resigned myself to simple forget. To let it all slip away. But there was one piece I couldn't let go of--a fragment I couldn't forget. Maybe that sliver of memory is what's kept me here this whole time...

That's strange. I'm running and running, but I can't get to Papa. Oh! This is hide-and-seek! I love hide-and-seek! I"m going to find Papa. He'll be so proud. Hmm... I can't find him. I give up, Papa! Come out! Come out! ...I've looked so hard for him. Isn't he looking for me? Wait, that's Papa's voice. I hear his voice! It's that light! I understand, now. I just have to run toward that light!

Sora?

Yes?

It's me, Naminé.

Naminé?

I'm so glad that you managed to hold on to who you are.

Why are you here?

I was in Kairi's heart, but then we were struck by a powerful darkness...and I woke up here.

And Kairi?

I can feel her heart. She's fighting with all her strength to keep you from fading away.

So, the reason I retained my form in this place...

It's because she's holding you together. Go to her.

I'm trying. But, what about you? I can't just leave you stuck here.

It's okay. Really. Kairi is where I came from. So, once she's safe again, Kairi is where I'll return.

Naminé, I know that I'm supposed to thank you. The datascape doesn't count. I need to say the words myself. But...not like this. You and Roxas can't tell me you're okay with this. I know how much you're hurting. I... felt that pain through Roxas.

He's the one they all miss. It's...not me.

Wrong. What about me, Kairi, Donald, Goofy? The King! Roxas too, he misses you! And someone else special I know won't let you down.

Sora. Thank you.

Well, then I'm gonna go save Kairi so at least you'll be free of this place. Okay?

Oh, wait!

Huh?

While sifting through memories, I spoke to Terra, the Keyblade Wielder you've been looking for. He has a strong will, and it keeps him tethered to the realm of light. I'll try tracing that connection. Maybe that'll be enough to tip the scales in the other direction.

Huh?

Umm... Let's just say I've got your back?

That part of you--it reminds me of Kairi. Thanks, Naminé. (realizing) Oh! That's not the official thank-you!

Uh-huh.

Well, see ya!

Be careful.

What a weird place.

What's going on?!

I gotta put myself back together. There's no time to waste.

Almost there.

I see that you found them all.

Yup!

Then, isn't it time that you left?

Oh, thanks.

What? I'm doing you a big favor here, you know. Don't push it.

Hey, Chirithy. You still look like you, right? Would you like me to help you find YOUR pieces?

Oh, I don't work like that.

So, like...you're waiting for someone to rescue you?

Mmm...sort of?

Well, tell me who! I'll find 'em.

Uh, no no no no, that's okay. He doesn't remember the past. Besides, I'm sure that he's much happier with his new friends. But I'll wait. He'll arrive here one day.

Okay...

I'll be back to visit you.

What?!

You and me are friends now.

Really? I've missed having friends.

Well, see ya 'round! And thanks!

Umm... Could I get a hint how to save the others?

Seriously? Are you a Keyblade wielder, or aren't you? Haven't you already learned how to restore someone's heart after it's been lost?

Restore their hearts? Is that the same thing as...the
?

I'm not sure, but...give it a shot?

No. This'll take all my heart. Okay.

Look for the light in the darkness!

May your heart be your guiding key.

Sora, you don't believe that. I know you don't.

Riku!

Riku! Answer me!

This is Herc's world. Is Riku here?

There's nobody here.

Gee, I'm here!

Jiminy! You're okay!

Well,
might be a stretch, but what are we waitin' for? We need to find the others!

Right!

Riku!

Forget the small fry! We gotta go after the one in charge.

We'll never stop 'em all. Leave 'em, Sora. We gotta keep going!

Hey! Wait!

There's no need to worry, Sora. He'll return to the place he fell, like you did. We gotta focus on rescuing the others.

Okay!

That scoundrel musta fled into one of those pools of shadow that're down below us.

Where do they lead?

Well, I think they might be portals to other worlds.

Okay! Maybe that's where we'll find the others.

If we hurry!

Hold still!

We oughta search every portal the shadows control.

Enough!

Stop that!

Let's try another portal. Aim for the ones wrapped in shadows!

Hey!

Hey, stop!

That's the last one! He must be hiding in there!

Well, Sora, I'd say we've been to every world that we can visit.

But we're one short. Where's Kairi's heart?

Gee, I wish I knew.

You!

All that gallivanting through the Sleeping Worlds, and yet you learned nothing.

What?

Dream by dream, you nearly buried yourself in the dark of sleep. And now you're at it again? The Lich you've been fighting--it's not like other Heartless.

It exists to usher hearts down to the depths of darkness. If you chase it, you will condemn your heart to that same abyss.

You're wrong. My heart is strong.

What do you think the power of waking is?

It's for traversing hearts to reach worlds. Not for traversing worlds to reach hearts. There's a high price to pay for wielding such power foolishly.

So what? You're worried about ME now?

No. There's no saving you.

You've paid the price. And it lies at the bottom of the abyss.

Wait!

Sora!

Hurry, Sora! The way to the Keyblade Graveyard is open!

Chipper and I found a new path!

Of course! That's the one place we haven't checked yet!

Off we go!

Sora.

Kairi!

I found you!

You see? I had no doubts that you'd pull through.

The light in the darkness. It was you. You're the one who kept me from fading away.

All I did was believe that you wouldn't.

I feel strong with you, Kairi.

The others are ahead. Come on.

I told you, Sora. You're safe with me.

Yeah.

You okay?

Yeah. Thanks, Kairi.

It DID work.

Of course!

Now point us back at those guys!

Right!

Terra!

Ven!

Terra! We found you!

Terra, please say you're in there.

What gives, Aqua?

I know that you're not him.

Now, let our friend go!

He IS their thirteenth.

Today is the day you all lose.

What?!

Before you even face the thirteen, every last one of you will be torn heart from body. But fear not.

The Chi-blade will still be forged.

We're not gonna lose to you.

Who are you?

Got you, Xehanort.

Terra?

This is impossible!

How I've waited for this moment.

Terra!

No, Ven!

But--

Them first.

We'll hold off the others.

Okay. We've got this!

I know what to do, Sora!

Go get 'em!

C'mon...

Something's wrong.

Look out!

What now?

Sora?

I'll stop it!

Sora!

Need some help?

Huh?

What is THIS?

All right. Let's go!

Now's our chance!

We're almost finished!

And...now!

Sora!

Are you okay?

Yeah.

What WAS that?

Keyblade wielders...from long ago.

It's the light of the past.

Look!

Just send out the Big Bad.

You!

The Organization's been using hearts. Ones Xehanort got to in the past and has influence over. So, that must be you from when Ansem had control of YOUR heart.

Yeah. How could I forget?

I'd say that was our finest hour.

Wrong. My hour of weakness.

You sure?

How about we find out?!

A real test for the Mark of Mastery!

What did you say?!

We gotta make sure you're not blundering your way toward a second failure.

Blundering? I'll have you know we failed with style, chief.

At least you admit it. Well, if you guardians think you brought the goods, you'll have to prove it to the old guy one last time.

Kid, take it away.

THIS again?

This isn't good.

Form up! Now!

If you try to use time magic against these numbers, you won't have enough strength for the final battle.

I'll try and break through. Everyone, get ready!

Alone? That's crazy! I'll help!

Two is no better.

Yeah, splitting up's a bad idea!

There's way too many!

We're finished!

Master Yen Sid!

Go, my young champions. I will hold them all here for as long as I can.

We're not gonna leave you behind!

You guys go on!

Me and Donald will stay here. The two of us'll back up Master Yen Sid!

Donald... Goofy...

You're a whole pint by yourself, Sora.

Don't worry. We'll catch up with ya in just a bit!

Okay!

We'll regroup later.

Make haste!

Today, we join these other wielders and leave our mark on fate. I have waited patiently...but together, we shall unlock the Keyblade War's secrets.

Now we forge it. The ultimate key...

The Chi-blade!

Here we go.

Riku!

Sora!

I will be your oblivion.

Desist!

R for reload!

Wait!

Ansem!

Where are YOU going?

Riku!

Hey, let's speed it up! Keep the line moving!

Hey, watch it!

Let's make it interesting!

But why?

You're not...real...

Huh?

I'm...the real one...

Aren't you my past self? From when Ansem possessed me?

No, you beat Ansem and you're still here. This guy...is me!

I knew it. It's a replica. A soon-to-be empty vessel. I've been waiting for a chance like this.

Hey! What are you doing? Take the vessel!

No.

The world already has you. There's someone else who needs the replica more. You know who I mean.

Naminé. You're saving her.

Good luck.

So... This is your power.

Figures.

If I had a Keyblade, it'd be different...

Like YOU'RE actually worthy to use one.

Oh, I AM worthy.

Whaddaya mean?

The old coot promised to bequeath me his. Why else do you think I would ever put up with all his nonsense?

It'd be wasted on you.

As if.

Is that a replica, for Naminé?

Yeah. Wish we could help her now. But first...

I know.

I'm going after Ansem.

Okay. I'll go help the others.

Your Majesty!

Sora!

Sora, come on!

Xemnas!

Exactly what I needed.

Sora, look out!

No!

Sora, one final game. The rules are simple. All you have to do to win is find me among these cards and strike me down.

Don't worry. I'll get you out!

Live dangerously, Sora.

Too bad!

Where'd I go?

I will break you!

Over here!

Impressive!

It's more fun when you beat the odds.

Look closely.

Fall!

Stop playing!

Yeah, yeah...

Good!

You were born for these sorts of games.

What's this?

A wild card. You've earned it. Hang on to it.

Could turn the tables.

Play ya again someday, when we're just guys.

I should like that very much, Sora.

Thanks.

I'll take this.

It's time to finish him!

So this is...your heart.

Oh... So, NOW it all comes back to me.

Hey. Is that a real laugh?

Yes... My heart is remembering how to feel.

Really? That's good.

And now, I am on the cusp of reclaiming my identity... My purpose for being... Thanks to you, Sora.

It's time for you to go!

You're mine!

Ugh... no way...

Are you kidding?

You're gonna be recompleted.

I didn't ask you for your garbage opinion. I lost! To a bunch of losers like you!

But...could be worse.

Become that geezer's heart tank? No thanks.

Then why help him?

I was really just along for the ride.

With...?

My secret.

Sora, I'll go after Xemnas, while you go find the others.

The sun's going down...

So, these panels in the floor are switches for the doors!

Aqua! Ven!

Sora.

Well, that's better. I was hoping to have company.

You will release my friend's heart!

Perish!

Come on!

Over here!

Annoying!

Let's go!

Dodge this!

You're nothing!

I need the rest of me!

Your face...!

I'm the piece of Ventus that was taken away. And you're the piece Ventus needed to be whole again. So...why shouldn't you and I look exactly the same? You define me, Sora, the same way that Ventus does. We are brothers who, together, make a greater whole.

Then why won't you stand by our side? Instead of with darkness?

Because I AM darkness. And I do stand by your side. I'm the shadow that you cast. How much closer could I be?

But I didn--

But I didn't ask for this.

To be sifted apart, nice and neat. We should be free to choose. Not just light...

...not just darkness. WE decide what we are.

But... Ventus, I DID decide who I am. You see?

And what you are is darkness?

What I am is darkness.

Okay.

How is that okay? Vanitas!

Dark times ahead!

Don't let him escape.

Break him!

What...? How?

Terra!

Aqua... Ven...

Terra, please...

Come back... Terra!

Terra! Your friends are here!

Terra!

Terra!

You have to fight the darkness!

You'll never be able to break these chains. They're OUR BONDS.

You have no power over me!

Stop, Terra!

Please, stop it!

Farewell.

No!

Terra... I kept my promise.

How?!

You fell to the dark--

One day...I...will...set...this...right...

One day...I will set...this right... I will return to this land...

...and protect...my friends!

Terra! Now!

Aqua! Ven!

Terra... Is it you?

Yeah. You never stopped lighting my way back.

You're here...

I heard you too, Ven.

You found me, just like you promised.

Thank you.

Aqua and Ventus need rest. Terra, look after them.

No, Sora. I'm going too.

That's what he wants. For us to make a mistake. Put ourselves in danger.

Sora, go. We'll catch up with you.

Right. I got this.

Kairi! Axel!

Sora!

Nice to see ya.

The moon shines down!

I call on the moon's pale light.

STOP IT! JUST STOP!

Stop it! Isa!

Xemnas...

There was a time when I trusted you to deal with traitors. And now, your betrayal outstrips them all. What final words do you have for your superior?

Well, let me think about it. How about,


Ah, ever the rogue pawn. Knocked from the board early in the game. Utterly useless and forgotten.

You kidding? Do you know how popular I am? I got loads of people rootin' for me. Sorry, boss. No one axes Axel. Got it memorized?

Is this supposed to be a Keyblade? Or is it some sort of joke?

Our plans have been dashed by you...far more times than I care to count. Now it ends. I will purge that light in you...

...with darkness!

Changing sides again?

We need him alive. You know that.

We only need his heart in order to forge the key. We do not need his soul. Oh...

...but that's right. You were
Then...YOU take his life.

Who...ARE you...?

Don't do this.

Wait...

It's all right! You can stop now!

It's all right... Xion.

Useless puppet.

Xion!

Your Keyblade is no more. And still you think you can play at being a guardian of light?

You can wait your turn...also-ran.

Hands off my friends.

It cannot be!

Roxas...

My turn.

Roxas...

This is impossible. Where did you get a vessel?

Same as you.

Same how...?

Most of the Organization's members--they traveled here from the past as hearts. And you had replicas ready and waiting. One for each of them.

Who told you?

I owe my return to many. Some of them people you knew.

Ansem the Wise. Zexion...

And others, too. It seems you're not as good at winning over people's hearts as you think.

Ah, I see...

There was one last thing I needed in order for me to be whole again. A connection. Sora helped me find my way back here...to my friends.

Roxas.

I don't need hearts. I will scatter them all to the winds!

Kairi!

Sora!

What difference does one little light make? You have others.

Just as we have more darknesses to replenish our ranks.

Rest, Axel. Roxas will fight in your place. And I'll fight for Kairi.

Yeah... When it comes to Keyblades, you're the old hands.

No escape!

Take this!

Abandon hope.

We still haven't achieved our goal...

Why...so sad?

You let them reduce you to THIS?

I thought...you outgrew the marks under your eyes.

So?

You look...like you need them...

Stop it. The whole act. I thought this was all for her.

At first. I sacrificed everything to try and track her down. You're the one who went off and made other friends. Left her and me both in the dust. It infuriated me how you just exited our lives.

I lost...all sense of purpose...

I didn't forget you.

Yes...I know. You wouldn't do that.

But... I was jealous.

You admit it.

Well, if I make it back...you won't get it out of me a second time.

See you, Isa.

See you, Lea.

You go help Kairi.

Right.

Gotta run! Good luck.

All right. What now?

Guess I...shoulda brought some ice cream.

It's night already?

Riku! Your Majesty!

Sora!

About time.

Sorry!

Xemnas! Where's Kairi?

Wait! Is she in trouble?

Yeah, Xemnas took her.

Settle down, boy.

It's Sora!

The thirteen darknesses and seven lights have clashed nine times, yielding these nine keys.

Keys?

We are four short... But those four keys will be produced here and now.

Yeah, sure. And what makes you think there'd ever be any way we'd help you with that?

You forget I plan for every eventuality.

Kairi!

If you do summon Kingdom Hearts, we will defeat you, and we will close it again.

Perhaps. That is...if you survive that long!

Sora, Riku, come on!

Go back to the shadows, Ansem!

Riku! King Mickey!

That's checkmate!

How the wielders weep for you!

Burst!

Surrender to it!

Desist!

Embrace the dark!

I reach for...the darkness...!

Ansem...

What...a journey you and I have had...

You know, it's strange. I think I'm gonna miss you.

Your strength is vaster than darkness. I knew I never stood a chance. Part of me wanted to defy my fate...but when the others betrayed us, I found I did not care. And then, nothing else seemed to matter anymore.

Ansem...

What? It is time to move on, boy...

There is more to seek...so go forth now, and seek it...

What am I feeling?

Bested...yet again...

I know that you have a heart. What do you feel? Was it worth it?

I feel...the emptiness where my companions once stood. I took them for granted. And now, I have...nothing. My first surge of emotion in years... for as long as I can remember...and it's...loneliness. Do you see? A heart is just pain.

Pain is being human, Xemnas.

Really? It must take...incredible strength...

Don't blink!

So this is where my role ends...

What's so funny?

I told you. There's a high price to pay for all of this.

And what price would that be?

I'll go back to my time, and live out my life. But Sora, you're done now.

Your journey ends here.

What?

Good-bye, Sora. Your time...in this world is--

Twelve keys we have now. Leaving just one more!

Now, Sora. Darkness and light's final clash.

Kairi!

You require motivation.

Kairi!!!

Why her?!

Why?!

I have done it.

Xehanort!!!

You'll pay!

Ultima!

Stopza!

Your Majesty! Riku!

Now...the Keyblade War will finally reach its conclusion!

The Chi-blade is complete.

Kingdom Hearts! I call upon your true form. Open now and show me the World to come.

Hey, don't give up.

We thought ya might be able to use a couple a' more half-pints.

Donald... Goofy...

Typical. You can't do anything without us, Sora.

Now wipe those tears, and let's go stop Master Xehanort!

Yeah...but...he controls Kingdom Hearts now. And Kairi...

You, worried?

Guys.

Sorry we took so long. Had a couple of plot points that needed ironing out.

Master Xehanort...

He did it. He opened Kingdom Hearts.

So, what now?

We've still got one hope.

Your Majesty, Riku, are you okay?

We're fine.

Yeah.

What hope?

It's Xehanort. During the Mark of Mastery exam, we learned that he can transcend space and time. He's a portal. And we can use that to trap him.

But, it won't be easy. Aqua, Riku, I'll need both your help if we're gonna push Xehanort out of this world.

Understood.

Wait. I'll do it.

What?

Kingdom Hearts is a much bigger threat. Let me handle Xehanort... while you guys keep it shut.

Okay, Sora.

I got this.

You can't forget about us.

Without Keyblades, it's not like we'll be much help here.

Three half-pints together again.

Let's move. The darkness is spreading.

Sora.

Oh, hey.

Kairi will be all right. I can feel it.

Thank you.

Do it!

What?!

Whoa. Where are we?

It's beautiful.

Admire it another time.

Right. We need to find Master Xehanort.

Yeah!

Xehanort has to be somewhere in town.

It sure is awful quiet here.

There's no one around.

Hey!

Wh-what?

What's going on?

Are you serious?

The Organization?

I don't think they're the locals.

Ready?

Of all the places to be sent.

Master Xehanort!

Behold, this town... Once a seat of power for all Keyblade wielders. It is the nexus from which all worlds spring.

Here, I and my other selves can be one. United...in Scala ad Caelum.

Come on!

Let's get him!

Yeah!

You guys okay?

Down!

Xehanort!

I admire your tenacity.

Concede!

Taste defeat!

This town shall be your resting place.

Arise!

You've performed admirably.

Just let it end, boy.

Your reward!

Consume!

You think you have won?

It's all over, Xehanort!

You thought you could contain me here...knowing all that you do about connections?

There is one sky, one destiny!

Destiny is never left to chance.

Chi-blade!

Come, Kingdom Hearts!

Judgement!

Enlighten me!

Kingdom Hearts!

Expire!

It ends here and now.

Why... How...

It's over now! You lost!

No, look... You are too late...

Are we really?

I don't know.

What's gonna happen?

A purge... The World will be returned whence it started. The World began in darkness. And from that darkness came light. From the light came the people, and the people had hearts. Evil burgeoned in those hearts, begetting more darkness. And that darkness spread across the World like a plague. The light, the symbol of the World's hope, was devoured by shadow, leaving nothing but ruin... An utter failure. But, the first light-- the light of Kingdom Hearts--it can give us a new start. An empty World, pure and bright...

It wasn't your decision to make.

Then whose was it?

The World needs someone to stand up and lead.

Someone strong, to stop the weak from polluting the World with their endless darkness. Someone to dictate their destiny.

If so...you're not that person, Xehanort.

A real leader knows that destiny is beyond his control...and accepts that.

You...make me think of an old friend.

Look!

You made it!

Are you okay?

Yep.

Kingdom Hearts is closing on the other side. But we managed to follow our hearts to you.

Master Xehanort...

There's more to light than meets the eye. As I told you.

You sly fox...

Now, hand over the Chi-blade, Xehanort.

It is too late.

For us, perhaps...but not for them.

No... I can do this.

Enough. Checkmate.

I told you that you might be surprised.

Yeah, you got me.

Huh? Really?

What?

It's just, you never admit it when you lose.

That's 'cause I never lose.

Oh, come on.

Good game today.

I try.

Maybe I won't go as far as you.

Huh?

When the World needs a defender, they'll pick you, Eraqus.

Y-you think?

But that doesn't mean that I can't be there for you.

Yeah. And I'LL be there for YOU.

Very well done.

Terra, Aqua, Ven. Forgive your foolish teacher.

Master!

Master!

Ven, I put you through such a harrowing experience.

And Aqua, I left you with such a heavy burden.

Terra, look after them for me. Please.

Here.

Ready, my friend?

Yes...

Sora, let's close it.

Everybody, help me out.

It's finally over.

...No.

We'll find Kairi. Let's head back to Master Yen Sid. We can figure it out.

No, I know what to do.

Sora...

My whole journey began the day I lost her. And every time I find her... she slips away again. I thought we'd finally be together. But she's out there, alone. Not for one more second.

We'll go too!

That's right!

Thank you, Donald, Goofy. But this time, I have to go it alone.

Sora, listen. The power of waking isn't to go chase hearts around! Even if you do locate Kairi, you might never come home to us again.

I will. And we'll both be back before you know it.

Please...

Let him go, Mickey.

Riku...

His heart and his mind are made up. Now, believe in him.

Yeah... Safe journey, Sora.

Thank you.

Finally, back where it belongs.

Did you summon us back?

Yep.

Is that you, Luxu? You look different.

Haven't heard that name in a long while. These days they call me Xigbar, but hey, whatever suits you.

Is it...really you?

Yeah, but some time ago, I had to cast my old form away. Been through plenty more semblances since, but it's still me underneath it all.

What happened? Why are we here? You tell me.

I had a role to play. And after all these years, it's done.

What role?

I guess Ava didn't make it after all.

Meaning what?

I told her, clear as day, what it is I had to do.

And is that why you decided to exclude her?

As if. Ava had her own mission, and she carried it out.

I've heard enough! Luxu, what was your role?

I hope you like long stories.

Oh, right.

What's this?

I heard about this new game.

Seven black pieces. And?

Just watch...

A scattered dream that's like a far-off memory. A far-off memory that's like a scattered dream. I want to line the pieces up--yours and mine.

You have arrived. I've been to see him... He looks a lot like you.

Who are you?

I'm what's left. Or... Maybe I'm all there ever was.

I meant your name.

My name is of no importance. What about you? Do you remember your true name?

My true name...is...

Sora.

Whoa!

Give me a break, Kai--!

Giving up already?

If there are any other worlds out there, why did we end up on this one?

This world has been connected.

Wh-who's there?

Tied to the darkness...

Sora, don't ever change.

The door has opened...

What?

You understand nothing.

So...ra...

Another dream about him...

Man, doesn't that tick you off?

Yeah, that's just wrong.

Seifer's gone too far this time.

I mean, it's true that stuff's been stolen around town. And we've got a score to settle with Seifer and everything. So if he wants to think we did it, I can't really blame him. See...that's not what really bugs me. What really bugs me is that he's goin' around tellin' everybody we're the thieves! Now the whole town and their mothers are treating us like the Klepto Club! Have you ever been this ticked off before in your life? 'Cause I haven't. Nuh-uh, never. Now...what to do.

Uh...well... We could find the real thieves. That would set the record straight.

Hey that sounds fun!

What about Seifer?

First, we gotta clear our names. Once we find the real culprit, everyone will get off our backs.

Oh no! They're gone!

Our ---- are gone!

What?

All our ------, gone? Huh?

Huh? You can't say -------? Why not?

But you do understand what I'm saying, right? Our ------ are gone!

Stolen... And not just the ------. The word ------! They stole it too!

What kinda thief is that? Seifer could never have pulled that off.

Yeah!

All right, time for some recon!

Huh?

His heart is returning. Doubtless he'll awaken very soon.

Huh?

Roxas, come on.

Over here!

Let's get this investigation underway.

Yo, Roxas. Never thought you'd do such a rotten thing...

We didn't steal anything, all right?

I'd like to believe you, but... Who else would steal that stuff?

What stuff?

As if you didn't know. Hey, I'm not gonna tell you. Go ask at the accessory shop.

Go on, Roxas--- ask her.

Oh, it's you, Roxas... Please don't let me down. You used to be one of my favorite customers.

I'm not a thief!

Okay...

It's no fun having everyone suspecting me, ya know.

Then you've got to find a way to clear your name. The woman at the candy shop is pretty disappointed, too.

Roxas? Have you seen my cat around?

Er...

Thank you, Roxas.

Did they steal something from you, too?

Oh, my, yes. Something important.

Just so you know, we didn't do it.

I believe you.

Thanks for that, ma'am. So what did they take from you?

My ------. My precious ------.

Looks like the culprit is going around stealing ------. And not just ------, but the word ------, too.

This isn't your average thief...

I wonder if Seifer would know anything about this.

We gotta talk to him. C'mon, to the sandlot!

Thieves.

That was low, y'know!

Oh yeah?

Nice comeback there, blondie.

What'd you say!?

You can give us back the ------ now.

Yeah! You're the only ones who would take it, y'know?

That was undeniable proof that we totally owned you lamers. So what did you do? Burn it? Ha, not that we need some ------ to prove that you're losers.

Replay!

Now you're talking!

I guess if you get on your knees and beg, maybe I'll let it slide.

Roxas!

Roxas, focus!

Kneel, loser!

Come on... quit playin' around and fight!

Seifer's not feelin' so hot, y'know!

Tournament decides.

What was that?

The thief!

We have come for you, my liege.

Huh?

It's no use...

What?

What...what is this thing?

What's this?

I was his first customer after he took over the shop. So we took a picture together.

It's a really nice photo. Oh...!

Hey! You just said
!

So, Roxas--tell us about the picture thief.

Not much to say. The pictures were just lying there.

Then how do we prove we weren't the ones who took 'em?

It's a girl...

You look happy, Roxas.

Do not.

So, like, anybody else notice that all the stolen pictures are of Roxas?

Ohh. So that's why everyone thought it was us.

You mean Seifer didn't go around accusing us after all?

Are they really all of me?

Yep.

See?

Look!

Right? Every single one. Wouldn't it be weird if the thief wanted to steal the real Roxas or something?

C'mon, get serious. Why would anyone wanna steal a bonehead like Roxas?

Oh, thanks!

Where...am I?

Who's there?

Who are you?

Restoration at 12%.

Organization miscreants... They've found us.

But...why would the Nobodies steal photographs?

Both are nothing but data to them. The fools could never tell the difference. We are running out of time. Naminé must make haste.

Oh...Where am I?

What happened to my home? My island?

Riku! Kai--!

Who are you?

They will come at you out of nowhere, as long as you continue to wield the Keyblade.

Hey, why don't you come with us? We can go to other worlds on our vessel.

Sora, go with them. Especially if you want to find your friends.

Donald Duck.

Name's Goofy.

I'm Sora. I'll go with you guys.

The Heartless have great fear of the Keyblade.

That's right. The Keyblade.

So...this is the key?

But the boy is a problem. He found one of the Keyholes.

A key...blade?

A Keyblade...

What was that about?

Oh!

Sorry... about that...

Thanks.

Do you guys think we'll always be together like this?

I sure hope so.

Huh? Where did that come from?

Oh, well, you know. Just thinking out loud.

Well, I doubt we can be together forever. But isn't that what growing up's all about? What's important isn't how often we see each other, but how often we think about each other. Right?

Get that off a fortune cookie?

That's it, no more ice cream for you! Man, today's turning out to be a drag.

Maybe because of yesterday's memory thief.

Nuh-uh. You know what it is? We don't want summer vacation to be over. That's all! So, how about this?

We all go to the beach! And why do we go to the beach? Because we haven't gone once this entire vacation! Blue seas! Blue skies! Let's just get on the train and go!

No? Aw, c'mon!

Maybe you forgot, but we're broke.

Maybe you forgot I'm smart!

Hurry up, Roxas!

We're going to Market Street!

Just two days to go. You and I have to make the finals! That way, no matter who wins, the four of us split the prize!

Okay, you're on.

You two are gonna clean up!

Go get 'em!

It's a promise! Now, let's get down to business. One ticket to the beach is 900 munny. How much for four of us?

3600 munny.

And 300 each to spend there. What's that for all of us?

1200 munny. A total of 4800 munny.

To spend on what?

Pretzels, of course! What else is there?

Well, there's always watermelon.

Too pricey. They're, like, 2000 munny apiece.

Pretzels it is.

So, where were we?

We need 4800 munny altogether. But all we have is...

I've got 800.

...650.

150. Sorry.

That's 1600 munny! We need another 3200. Let's find ourselves some odd jobs and earn some dough! We have 'til the train leaves to earn 800 munny each!

Meet at the station with cash in hand!

Didn't he say he had it covered?

Whatever. Those pretzels are sounding pretty good.

All present and accounted for?

What've we got?

Let's see...

Just this.

Good job.

Nice work, everyone. Added to what we started with, we now have...

Tada! 5000 munny!

Sweet!

Let's get tickets!

We can't be together forever... so we'd better make the time we do have something to remember.

Huh?

Gotcha!

Whoa!

Huh?

What?

Roxas! Three minutes!

Okay!

Four students!

Roxas, the money!

Wait--

No!

Huh?

He took it!

Where are you going?

Remember when I fell? I had the money before that. I bet that guy took it!

Guy?

He couldn't have gotten too far...

What are you talking about?

There was no guy.

Huh? But he... There wasn't... Really?

Oh boy...

There wasn't anyone...there?

It's melting.

Sorry.

Cheer up already!

That was definitely weird, though.

Strange.

You said it.

Can you feel Sora?

Can you feel Sora?

Restoration at 28%.

Naminé, hurry.

Is it really that hard to make a beach?

We'd be giving the enemy another entry point.

And this?

We can always buy some sea-salt ice cream.

Objects from that town must be kept out of the real world. You can delete that.

As the key bearer, you must already know one must not meddle in the affairs of other worlds.

So many places I want to see... I know I'll get there someday.

Thus, I do hereby dub thee junior heroes.

Hey! What do you mean
?

You rookies still don't understand what it takes to be a true hero.

I...I wish... ...for your freedom, Genie.

Al!

Sally, why didn't I listen to you?

Don't feel bad, Jack. We'll come up with another plan for Halloween. Next time, we'll do it together.

Power!

I am Mushu.

Or are you too cool to play them now that you have the Keyblade?

Riku! What are you doing here?

Did you find her?

I still can't believe it. I really flew. Wait 'til I tell Kai--.

I wonder if she'll believe me. Probably not.

I'm searching, too.

For your light? Don't lose sight of it.

Sora, where are you going?

I'm gonna go look for my friends. They're waiting for me.

Where are Donald and Goofy?

Instead of worrying about them, you should be asking about her.

Who are you?

Huh...?

Hey.

Morning.

Huh...?

Hello, Roxas.

Uh... Hi... And you are...?

I wanted to meet you at least once.

Me?

Yes, you.

Olette dragged me along to go shopping.

Hey, you wanna come with us?

Um, uhh, wait... did you just see that...

He's stalling.

Very well, then. We'll see you later, Roxas, okay?

Y-Yeah...

Did she go to that haunted mansion?

Huh?

Lemme go!

Hey, chicken wuss.

Who's that?

I dunno, but they've already crossed the line. Find a weapon!

Not good...

Roxas! Use the Keyblade!

Be careful. Beyond that door lies a completely different world. But don't be afraid.

Don't stop walking...

My name is Naminé. Roxas... Do you remember your true name?

Say no more, Naminé.

But if no one tells him, Roxas will...

It's best he doesn't know the truth.

Hey! You're that pickpocket!

Seifer, strike a pose, y'know?

How's this?

That's totally perfect, y'know!

How 'bout one more, y'know?

What's that for!?

Keepsake.

Those freaks in the white jumpsuits are gone, y'know?

Cakewalk.

What were those things?

Outsiders, that's what.

And if they don't wise up to the rules around here, I might have to take


Oh yeah, Seifer's always lookin' after the town, y'know?

Wait up!

Hey! No chickening out of the tournament tomorrow!

We'll be waitin', y'know?

So...you hung out with Seifer's gang today?

N-no... It's not like that... Oh yeah! How was the beach? Wasn't that today?

We didn't go. It wouldn't be the same without you, right?

...Sorry. Hey...how 'bout we go tomorrow? We could get those pretzels and...

I promised I'd be somewhere.

Ohh... Oh!

You and I have to make the finals! That way, no matter who wins, the four of us split the prize!

Okay, you're on.

You two are gonna clean up!

Go get 'em!

It's a promise!

I'm outta here.

Restoration at 48%.

Was that Naminé made of data?

No. Naminé hijacked the data herself. Look what she's done now... She's totally beyond my control!

Calm down.

It doesn't matter. As long as Naminé accomplishes her goal we needn't worry about what befalls Roxas.

It's up to me. Only the Keyblade master can open the secret door and change the world.

But I'm not gonna betray Sora, either.

All for one and one for all.

My friends are my power!

So, your heart won this battle.

It is I, Ansem, lead me into everlasting darkness!

Sora!

Forget it! There's no way you're taking Kairi's heart!

Kairi.

We may never meet again, but we'll never forget each other.

No matter where we are, our hearts will bring us together again.

Take this. It's my lucky charm. Be sure to bring it back to me.

Don't worry. I will.

Promise.

Don't ever forget. Wherever you go, I'm always with you.

Right...
...

What a mess...

Hurry to the sandlot! You're gonna be late!

Who you gonna root for?

Both of them, silly.

Ladies and gentlemen, Struggle-fiends of Twilight Town! It's time for summer's most sizzling clash! That's right! Today is the day for the Struggle and title match! Who will be the one to break through the ranks and take on our champion, Setzer!?

Seifer, y'know!?

And who will leave today as our new Struggle Champion!?

Hayner! Roxas!

Setzerrrrr!

Setzer! Setzer! Setzer! Setzer! Setzer!

Yes, the crowd is fired up, so you know what comes next Let's...

STRUGGLE!

Hey, now. It's time to introduce today's combatants! The four bad boys who struggled their way through the preliminaries! Regular finalist and head of the Twilight Disciplinary Committee Seifer! Completely out of nowhere--who knew he'd make it so far this year? Vivi! An underground favorite and local attitude problem Hayner! It's his first trip to the finals! And Struggler number 4, who happens to be my absolute favorite customer Roxas!

So--who will win this sweltering summer Struggle!? Who will take home the grand prize? The summa cum laude of Struggle--- the Four Crystal Trophy! AND...a chance to take on our defending champion, Setzer!

It won't be long now, folks. I suggest our challengers go over the official Struggle Rules before we begin!

Hey... Sorry about yesterday.

What, you still worried about that? You need to learn to let that stuff go.

I've got a lot on my mind.

Sorry, man.

Wait, what am I sorry for?

Our first match of today's Struggle tournament will be between Roxas and his best friend Hayner!

Ready, Roxas?

And the winner is Roxas!

Not even friendship will slow this kid down. And Hayner put up a great fight, too.

I lost. Awww, I can't believe it!

I guess I taught you well.

I had a lot of fun fighting you.

Yeah, well I didn't, wise guy.

Hey, let's find a way to cheer you up.

Nah, that's all right.

Out of the way.

You in a rush to lose?

Don't mess with your elders.

Whew, just look at those sparks fly! I guess Seifer didn't expect to fight one of his own boys!

When did Vivi get so tough?

You're mine!

I-I'm not sure what just happened... Um...but...the winner is Vivi! In a positively blistering comeback!

That's not Vivi.

Huh?

Thrash 'im.

It looks like Seifer's withdrawn from the Struggle for third place.

So I'm in third now? Aw, baby!

Keep it clean, fellas.

And now, the match you've been waiting for Roxas vs. Vivi!

Again!?

Again...

Roxas. All right. Fight fight fight.

You really don't remember? It's me. You know, Axel.

Axel?

Talk about blank with a capital
Man oh man, even the Dusks aren't gonna crack this one.

Wait a sec, tell me what's going on!

This town is his creation, right? Which means we don't have time for a Q & A. You're coming with me, conscious or not. Then you'll hear the story.

Uh-oh.

What's going ON!?

Number 13. Roxas. The Keyblade's chosen one.

Okay, fine! You asked for it!

That's more like it!

Not bad, Roxas.

So it was you.

Roxas, this man speaks nonsense!

Roxas, don't let him deceive you!

Roxas!

Roxas!

Hayner...Pence...Olette... Hayner! Pence! Olette!

What? What just happened?

Huh? ...How did I get here?

Roxas!

Ladies and gentlemen, Roxas--our new top Struggler!

Roxas?

Setzeerrrr!

Setzer! Setzer! Setzer! Setzer! Setzer!

Roxas! It's starting!

You two, play fair now. You're at the top of the bracket.

There's only room for one up here.

Well, may the best man win!

Hey, Rucksack. How about you throw the match for me?

Roxas! Focus!

Let me win, and I'll make it worth your while.

Get real!

Roxas, our underdog hero, versus Setzer, our defending champion! The winner of this match will be the true champion! That's bragging rights for a whole year, folks!

Whatever you think is right, you're wrong. And that is a big mistake. My life's a chip in your pile. Time to ante up!

I'm not supposed to lose!

Roxas! Roxas! Roxas! Roxas! Roxas!

Roxas!

You did it!

That was awesome, Roxas!

As promised.

Thanks a ton, Roxas!

One more treasure for us to share.

I've got a present, too...for all of us.

Whoa!

Kairi! Wait up!

Hey, do you feel like going out to the island? Tidus and Wakka are all wrapped up in their ballgame and they won't go with me.

Not today, sorry.

Aw, why not?

Do you remember those boys who used to hang out with us?

Riku?

Yeah.

I wonder whatever happened to him. I sure miss him.

He's far away. But I know we'll see him again.

Sure. Of course we will.

And the other boy?

What other boy?

The one who was with Riku and me all the time---we played together on that island. His voice always used to be there...but now it's gone. I can't think of his face, or his name. I feel awful about it. So I told myself--I'm not going to the island until I remember everything about him.

Are you sure you didn't make him up?

Naminé?

Naminé...? What's happening to me?

Who are you? And that's not my name. I'm Kairi.

Kairi... I know you. You're that girl he likes.

Who? Please, a name!

I'm Roxas.

Okay, Roxas, but can you tell me HIS name?

You don't remember my name? Thanks a lot, Kairi! Okay, I guess I can give you a hint. Starts with an


Are you okay?

Kairi...?

What's that?

A letter... I wrote it yesterday, to the boy I can't remember. I said that no matter where he is... I'll find him. One day. And when I stopped writing, I remembered we made a promise, something important. This letter is where it starts. I know it.

Wow... I hope he gets it.

He will. Starts with an
Right, Sora?

Restoration at 79%.

His progress is astounding.

So what happened?

Naminé's encounter with Roxas put his heart in contact with Kairi's. And that, in turn, affected Sora. You see?

Naminé?... She's a wonder.

She wasn't born like other Nobodies. She can interfere with the hearts and memories of Sora and those aligned with him.

But whose Nobody is she?

I could tell you... But first, perhaps you could tell me your true name?

It's Ansem.

It's an honor, Ansem!

No way!? It's too soon! You can't seriously get rid of him?!

It's an order. Why do you hesitate? You, who has been ruthless towards those who've turned their backs on the Organization?

But it's not like that! He didn't betray us! He can't come back!

If he doesn't return, you know what you must do. Or you will face the consequences.

So, you'll turn me into a Dusk...
Tch, all right! I'll do it, if that's what you want!

I'm dreaming... But which parts...were the dream?

Only three days left of summer vacation--so don't even mention that assignment!

But we agreed we'd get it finished today.

Yesterday... I fell off the station tower, didn't I?

You wouldn't be here if you did!

But man, that was a close one...

Stop changing the subject!

Okay, already! You win. We'll do the homework. Stupid independent study. So, anybody got any bright ideas for a topic?

Maybe we could study the stuff that's happening to me. You know, the dreams--- and the guys in white...

Forget it.

Why?

You know, things have been weird with you and the town since the photos were stolen, right?

Well, tomorrow, we're all gonna search the town and find out what's been goin' on.

Lots of people are helping out.

All that for me?

I'll go get some ice cream!

There's this strange rumor going around. Wanna hear it? You know the stone steps at Sunset Station? We use 'em all the time, without even thinking about it. But---and this is the weird part---the steps count different going up and down!

Seriously!?

And there are six other weird stories like that. It's like...the seven wonders of Twilight Town.

We should investigate those for our school project! Pence, you're a genius!

There might be other rumors going around, too. Let's split up! I'm gonna look for the seven wonders...

Olette and I will go find some new rumors! C'mon!

That leaves you and me, Roxas. Let's try the train first. To the station!

The time has come! Our hunt for the seven wonders begins!

Whoa! Find new rumors already?

Nothing on Market Street.

You twerps aren't gonna scoop us. We're going to the terrace with you.

Hayner, it's not a race!

Well, it is now!

C'mon, we can all go.

Olette! Hurry!

Huh. Aren't these the steps you talked about? The ones that count different going up and down?

Umm...actually, it's the stupidest thing ever, but...

What?

Rai's the one who counted. He's like,
Ha ha ha ha!

So...he just counted wrong?

Hey, no worries.

Oh, it's just you, Roxas. Were you throwing a ball? That ball flew out of nowhere and totally startled me. Hey, I know! This explains one of those seven wonders!

Vivi?

What is it, Roxas?

Oh, did you need this, Roxas? Planning on getting in some practice, I bet.

Er, no, it's just that... there were so many of you...

Huh? So...many of me? I don't get it. Anyway, I'm done with this, Roxas. You can take your time.

So the mystery voice was just Vivi practicing.

Listen, there were a whole bunch of Vivi clones here just a minute ago...

Roxas!

You all right?

Now that's spooky! I thought I saw someone, but it was just my reflection. I bet this is behind one of the seven wonders!

Another...me?

Yikes!

Oh, it was just a dog. Did you let it out of the sack, Roxas?

This explains one of those seven wonders!

You know...that last wonder wasn't exactly wonderful.

I understand, say no more. But this next one's gonna be really great! Wonder number Six!

We got another lead!


...

Everybody knows about Wonder number Six!

Yeah, well, I didn't.

Did you find out where the train runs?

You can see it from Sunset Hill.

If the rumors are true, it'll be here any minute... For they say the train is empty. No driver, no conductor, no passengers... NO RETURN.

We've gotta make it to the beach next year.

Yeah. We better get jobs the second vacation starts.

Good afternoon, slackers.

What are you doing out here?

What do you care?

I don't. Tell me anyway.

We're waiting for the ghost train.

Waiting for the ghost train!

Why does looking at you always tick me off?

I dunno. Maybe it's destiny.

Destiny... In that case, let's be friends. I don't feel like cooperating with destiny.

When have you ever cooperated with anything?

Seifer!

I know. Tomorrow.

Look!

It's really true... And there's really no one aboard! What's the catch? There's gotta be a catch, right?

Then it's real? Let's go to the station!

Let's go in!

What?

Um...you'll get hurt.

Huh?

The train will be arriving shortly.

C'mon.

A train came from the beach. There was no driver, right?

Let's go...

Right?!

Let's go home and work on the paper.




We can still make it sound good if we write about all the work we did.

But what about the last one---the seventh wonder?

Who cares?

I do. C'mon, Pence.

Whatever!

Roxas...

It's at that haunted mansion.

You know something...

We were gonna check the mansion out tomorrow. It IS the most suspicious place.

Right...

Even Seifer's gang was gonna help.

Seifer?

Yeah, Hayner asked him to.

So, what're we lookin' for?

Well, they say there's a girl who appears at the second floor window even though no one's lived here for years.

Roxas...

Naminé?

This is...me? ...And Axel's here too.

You ARE best friends...

Very funny.

Don't you want to know the truth about who you really are?

No one knows me better than me.

Of course...

But...I don't get what's been happening lately.

You know these three, don't you?

Yeah. Sora, Donald, and Goofy. They're from the dreams.

About a year ago, some things happened, and I had to take apart the memories chained together in Sora's heart. But now... I'm putting them all back exactly the way they were. It's taken me a long time, but pretty soon Sora will be his old self again. The process has been affecting you, too, Roxas.

You mean...the dreams?

Yes... You and Sora are connected. And...in order for Sora to become completely whole again... He needs you.

Me? What for?

You hold half of what he is... He needs you, Roxas.

Naminé?

Naminé...who are you?

I'm a witch with power over Sora's memories and those around him.

A witch?

That's what DiZ called me. But I don't know why I have this power...I just do. I'm not even sure there's a right way for me to use it.

Hmm...I can't help you there.
It's funny... Suddenly I feel like I don't know myself at all... I guess I would like to know. What do you know about me...that I don't?

You...you were never supposed to exist, Roxas.

What...? How could you even say such a thing...even if it were true?

I'm sorry. I guess some things really are better left unsaid.

Roxas! Roxas!

Huh?

Did you see her?

Yeah. Watch the window---closely.

Oh, lame. That's just the curtains moving. There must be a draft somewhere. I'm surprised this old place even has curtains.

...Yeah.

Well, let's head back to the usual spot. Hayner and Olette are waiting.

Hey guys, how'd it go?

The girl in the window turned out to be a curtain flapping in the wind.

I figured as much. The report's already done.

All right!

So, wanna go find Hayner? He's probably at the station.

You know...we only have two more days together.

Huh?

Summer vacation, remember?

Oh...right.

Tomorrow we search the town.

Next day's the fair.

The last day of summer.

Don't say that! You'll give me an ulcer!

Not if you explode from all that ice cream first.

Why did you show him the train?

Because he missed the trip to the beach.

Hmph...that's almost kind of you.

Now...what about you? Are the holes in your memory starting to fill in?

Yes...the haze is clearing.

The same thing is happening to everyone who had ties to Sora. Very soon, to them, he'll be like a good friend who's gone away for a year.

I've waited, and now I want to know. What is it that you want?

Revenge.

Revenge...

Now, for the finishing touches. First, we must dispose of Naminé. She did a splendid job with Sora, but it's high time she disappeared. Roxas isn't the only one who was never meant to exist. Take care of it, Ansem.

Restoration at 97%.

Gawrsh, is that all that's left of the worlds taken by the Heartless?

Those worlds will be restored if we beat Ansem, right? But, if we do beat him and all these worlds become restored and disconnected, what's gonna happen to this place? And to us?

All worlds begin in darkness, and all so end. The heart is no different. You see, darkness is the heart's true essence.

That's not true! The heart may be weak. And sometimes it may even give in. But I've learned that deep down, there's a light that never goes out!

Kingdom Hearts! Fill me with the power of darkness!

You're wrong. I know now, without a doubt, Kingdom Hearts is light!

Now, Sora! Let's close this door for good!

Take care of her.

Kairi!

Sora!

Kairi, remember what you said before? I'm always with you, too. I'll come back to you. I promise!

I know you will!

Well, now what do we do?

We've gotta find Riku and King Mickey.

But, uh, where do we start lookin' for that there door to the light?

Pluto?

Gawrsh, that's the king's seal!

Hey, have you seen King Mickey?

Let's go!

I've been to see him. He looks a lot like you.

Who are you?

Why!? Why do you have the Keyblade?

Shut up!

Man, I could not sleep last night...

Guys?

Huh?

Look at what it's come to. I've been given these icky orders to destroy you---if you refuse to come back with me.

We're...best friends, right?

Sure...but I'm not getting turned into a Dusk for...Wait a sec! You remember now!?

Y...eah.

Great! But, you know, gotta make sure and all. So, umm... What's our boss's name?

Can't believe this...

Roxas, to the mansion! The time has come!

Hayner! Pence! Olette!

The Roxas that I know is long gone. Fine, I see how it is...

Don't call me and then lock me out...

Your mind's made up?

Why did the Keyblade choose me? I have to know.

You can't turn on the Organization!

Organization XIII... they're a bad group.

Bad or good, I don't know. They're a group of incomplete people who wish to be whole. To that end, they're desperately searching for something.

What?

Kingdom Hearts.

Funny?

It's just, I think---I've been running away from the question I really wanna ask

What's gonna happen to me now? Just tell me that. Nothing else really matters anymore.

You are...

Naminé!

There's no knowledge that has the power to change your fate.

Even if it doesn't, I wanna know. I have the right to know!

A Nobody doesn't have a right to know. Nor does it even have the right to be.

But what IS a Nobody!?

DiZ, we're out of time. Too many Nobodies!

Roxas. Nobodies like us are only half a person. You won't disappear. You'll be whole!

I'll...disappear...?

No further outbursts!

No, you won't disappear! You'll--

Wait!

Roxas! We will meet again. And then we can talk about everything. I may not know it's you, and you may not know it's me. But we will meet again. Someday soon. I promise!

Let her go!

Naminé!

Why!? Why do you have the Keyblade?

Shut up!

Will it work?

If we can maintain the simulated town until Naminé finishes chaining together Sora's memories.

What will happen to Roxas?

He holds half of Sora's power within him. In the end, he'll have to give it back.

Until then, he'll need another personality to throw off his pursuers.

Poor thing.

It's the fate of a Nobody.

Simply amazing, Roxas.

Axel.

You really do remember me this time? I'm SO FLATTERED.

But you're too late!!

Two!?

Come here. I'll make it all stop.

Roxas...

You get on their bad side and they'll destroy you!

No one would miss me.

That's not true... I would.

Axel...

Let's meet again in the next life.

Yeah. I'll be waiting.

Silly. Just because you have a next life...

...Donald. ...Goofy?

At last, the Keyblade's chosen one.

Who are you talking to? Me? Or Sora?

To half of Sora, of course. You reside in darkness. What I need is someone who can move about the realm of light and destroy Organization XIII.

Why? Who are you?

I am a servant of the world.
And if I'm a servant, then you should consider yourself a tool, at best.

Was that... Was that supposed to be a joke?

'Cause I'm not laughing!

My apologies. This is only a data-based projection.

Come, over here.

I hate you so much...

You should share some of that hatred with Sora. He's far too nice for his own good.

No! My heart belongs to me!

Sora...

You're lucky. Looks like my summer vacation is...over.

Sora?

Who's there?

Sora!

Sora, wake up.

Donald, Goofy!

That was some nap!

You mean, we were asleep?

I guess we musta been, or I don't think we'd be so drowsy...

When do ya think we went to sleep?

Uhh...

Let's see...we defeated Ansem...

Yep.

...restored peace to the world...found Kairi... Oh yeah, and then we went to look for Riku. I think that's right so far.

Then what?

What does your journal say, Jiminy?

Gee, there's only one sentence...
Hmm... I wonder who that is.

Some journal that is.

Well, what do ya say we find out where we are!

You know, I think I've been to this town.

What's it called?

Hmm... Guess I must've imagined it.

What do you want!?

Uh, nothing. Just wondering what was back here.

Now you know. This is our spot.

Umm...

What?

You're...new around here, right? I'm Pence.

Hayner. Nice to meet you, but we got stuff to do, so catch ya later.

My name's Olette. Hey, did you finish up the summer homework, yet? Independent studies are the worst, huh?

Homework?

Hey, what're your names?

Oh, sorry. We're Sora, Donald, and Goofy.

Hey there.

Sora, Donald, Goofy, we just met someone who was looking for you.

He sure seemed in a hurry. He had a black coat on so I couldn't see his face, but he had these big round ears.

The King!

Where'd you see him?

At the station.

The station! Thanks!

Well, we'd better get back to that assignment.

Later.

Oh boy! The King's trying to find us!

Yeah, let's get to the station!

Hey you, where'd you come from?

Uhh...

You here to pick a fight with us or something?

Fight? We're not here to fight.

Yeah, you big palooka!

Okay, smartalecks... Time to teach you how to behave in my town. Bring it!

Man, what a jerk.

One moment!

If you're gonna fight, why not make it a proper Struggle?

What?

You see, Seifer... I'm a really big fan.

Wh-what do you want?

In other words, I want to see more of your
moves! You handled the tournament with real style, and you absolutely dominated the title match. But I just can't get enough. Don't you see? The matches are far too short!

And what's your name?

Sora.

Sora, if you wanna fight a match, you just say the word.

Your Majesty?

Shh! You gotta board the train and leave town! The train knows the way.

Here.

Your Majesty...

The King... Was that really him?

It coulda been... Yep, I know it was!

Now we know he's okay!

The King was locked in the realm of darkness, right?

Uh-huh.

But we just saw him...

Yep.

And if the King is here, that means Riku's here!

He's gotta be!

Well, I'm gonna go look for Riku. Then he and I can go back to the islands together. Kairi's there waiting for us! What are you two gonna do?

Gawrsh, Sora. Do ya have to ask?

Hey! What's so funny!?

Your face!

What do ya say, guys? Let's stick together for one more journey.

To...where again?

We hafta board the train!

Oh yeah.

C'mon!

Wait up!

Hey, Sora...

What?

Nothing, but...

We came to see you off. It just seemed like something we oughta do.

Oh...really? Thanks!

You should hurry and get your tickets.

Right.

What is it?

They're the same.

Yeah.

Three tickets, please!

I can't help feeling like we won't see this town again...

Why not?

You're thinkin' too much.

Yeah, you're right!

Okay, let's go!

Bye.

Hey, Sora. You sure we haven't met before?

Positive. Why do you ask?

I dunno.

Huh?

You okay?

Y-yeah. Don't know where it came from.

Pull it together.

Right... See ya.

You know...

I'm sad.

We'll be back.

Yeah. We can visit Hayner and those guys again.

Guess that's that.

Let's go.

Go where? It's not like we have homes to return to. We don't exist, remember?

Yes, it's true. We may not have homes. But there is someplace I want to go... And someone I want to see...

Same here.

So, you think you might let us go? I know you're here to get rid of us, but...

DiZ wants to get rid of me?

Go.

You sure about this?

I owe you both.

For what?

Castle Oblivion. You helped us.

Heh, you don't have to tell me twice.

Thank you.

There goes our ride...

What's goin' on?

I sent some of my lackeys inside to see if the master of this here tower's as big and tough as they say. Word is, he's a real powerful sorcerer. Which would make him the perfect bodyguard for me. See, it don't matter how tough he is---once he's a Heartless, he'll do as I say!

A Heartless?

That's right. They're those things that come outta the darkness in folks' hearts. Why, with all those Heartless at her side, my dear friend Maleficent is gonna conquer everything! And since I got me a debt to pay, I'm goin' 'round to a bunch of different worlds and buildin' an army of Heartless, special for her. Why am I talkin' to you pipsqueaks anyway? Go on, scram! I'm behind schedule as it is.

You oughta find somethin' nicer to do.

Says who?

Wha...AAAH! It's you!

Pete!

What are you two nimrods doin' here!?

What are YOU doing here?

You know him?

We sure do! Pete's been causin' trouble for ages! His Majesty banished him to another dimension a long time ago. I wonder how he escaped.

You wanna know how, eh? Well, Maleficent busted me out, that's how! And now your world---no, no, no, all the worlds---are gonna belong to yours truly. Cause Maleficent's gonna help me conquer 'em!

Maleficent...huh.

What are you laughing at!? Why, Maleficent's power is so great---

She's toast!

Huh?

Sorry, but Maleficent can't help ya now.

Whaddaya mean!?

You! So you're the ones that did it!

Well...we mighta had something to do with it.

Heartless squad! Round up!

You just wait! Nobody, and I do mean nobody, messes with the mighty Pete!

So,
Pete, who lives in this tower, anyway?

Oh, ya don't know, eh? Well, it's old Yen Sid. 'Course he's probably a Heartless by now!

Master Yen Sid lives here!?

Yen Sid is the King's teacher!

Wow. Sounds powerful!

Heartless, Heartless, Heartless! Things haven't changed one bit!

Well, it's a good thing we're on the job, then.

So the worlds aren't at peace after all?

Master Yen Sid! It's an honor!

Hey there!

Sora! Show some respect!

So, you are Sora. Now then, have you seen the King yet?

Yes, we did, Master. But we didn't get a chance to talk to him.

Yes...the King has been quite busy of late. Therefore, it would seem that the task of instructing you three falls upon my shoulders. You have a perilous journey ahead of you. You must be well prepared.

You mean...we have to go on another quest? I was looking forward to finding my friend Riku, so we could go back to the islands.

Yes. I know. However, everything in your journey, Sora, is connected. Whether you will find your way home to the islands... Whether you will return alone or with your friend... And, whether or not the islands will still be there. And the key that connects them all is you, Sora.

I'm...the key?

Chosen wielder of the Keyblade! You are the key that will open the door to light.

This book contains valuable knowledge you will need for your journey. Study it carefully. Once you have finished, we will speak of the enemies you will surely confront.

But wait a sec---how come the Heartless are still running around?

Your past endeavors did prevent an immense effusion of Heartless from the great darkness; make no mistake about that. However, the Heartless are darkness made real---and darkness lingers yet in every heart. The Heartless are fewer. But while darkness exists in a single heart, it will be difficult to eliminate them.

Gawrsh, that must mean...if everybody's heart was full of light, them Heartless'd go away!

Now it is time to speak of the enemies that you will encounter.

If one such as you, Donald, yields to the darkness in their heart, they too will become a Heartless. But you know this. The Heartless are always lurking and ever seeking to capture new hearts. Never let your guard down! Now then...

At times, if someone with a strong heart and will---be they evil or good---becomes a Heartless, the empty shell they leave behind begins to act with a will of its own.

An empty vessel whose heart has been stolen away... A spirit that goes on even as its body fades from existence---for you see, Nobodies do not truly exist at all. Nobodies may seem to have feelings, but this is a ruse---they only pretend to have hearts. You must not be deceived!

Nobodies... They don't exist...

Now then...the being you see before you is known as a Dusk. They are the most common form of Nobody. But there are others---some larger, some with frightening and unique powers. Be vigilant! On your journey, you will meet an alarming number of Dusks. They will all attempt to do you harm.

Still, they are nothing but empty shells, destined to return to the darkness. But---

The beings you see before you now are different. These powerful Nobodies have formed a group called Organization XIII. It commands the lesser Nobodies.

Organization XIII...

While Heartless act on instinct, Nobodies function in a higher manner. They can think and plan. And it seems they are working towards a goal. What that goal is, we do not know. The King sensed the danger, and journeyed forth to fight it. He found the dark realm's Keyblade, and with it, closed the door. Now he's traveling from world to world, fighting the Heartless as he seeks the answer to the riddle of the Nobodies and Organization XIII.

Then I guess we better go find the King first!

But where could he be?

Well, we won't know 'til we look.

Yeah. And the King must know where Riku is, 'cause the two of them were together in the realm of darkness when we closed the door. You know, after defeating Ansem.

So, before you go, you will need more suitable traveling clothes. Those look a bit too small for you.

Through there, you'll find three good fairies. If you ask, they'll create for you appropriate garments.

Gawrsh, Sora, you sure are growing fast.

Uh, I guess...

Me, you guys, Riku, and the King. I don't care who this Organization is or what it's planning. With the five of us---I mean, six of us---there's nothing to worry about, right?

Yeah!

Well, look who's here, dears! Sora, Donald, and Goofy!

Ooh, if you're looking for clothes, you've come to the right place!

I'll do the designing.

Oh, that will never do.

Now, now, dears.

But don't you like this better?

Hold on!

Are you certain?

Blue!

Aww, would you just decide?

All right, then. Together now, dears. And no more squabbling!

Oh, my!

Ooh, it's lovely.

Oh, yes! He does look very dashing.

Now, those aren't ordinary garments.

They have very special powers.

Take the orb, dear.

And watch what happens.

Whoa!

Wow!

Two Keyblades!

This journey's gonna be twice as difficult as your last.

Your garments also have other powers---but you will have to discover what they are as you continue on your journey.

Okay, I'll do my best. And thanks a lot!

Oh, and there's something else for you---from Master Yen Sid.

Oh boy!

Hey! It's the Gummi Ship!

So you guys ready to go?

Now, now, just a moment.

Because of your previous endeavors, the worlds have returned to their original states. That means the pathways between them have disappeared.

How do we get around?

Do not fear. If what the King suspected proves true, the worlds have prepared new pathways along which you may travel. These pathways may be utilized by unlocking special gates. How these gates are opened, I'm afraid I do not know... However, the Keyblade will serve as your guide. When a beam of light radiates from the Keyblade, return to the Gummi Ship. Though the worlds may seem far apart and out of reach, they nonetheless remain connected by invisible ties. As do our hearts.

Our hearts are connected.

That is correct.

Got it!

But be warned. As you proceed... The Heartless and the Nobodies will be using their own paths Corridors of darkness, to travel from world to world. They may be attempting to link these dark pathways to the gates between the worlds.

Hey! That's not fair!

Now then, that is all the information I can give to you. Go forth, Sora, Donald, and Goofy. Everyone is waiting.

Okay, let's get going!

Master Yen Sid!

We sure do appreciate the help.

My goodness, what's that!?

Haven't we seen this somewhere before?

Yes, dear. I wonder whose it was...

Oh, Malefi---

No! We mustn't remember her name! Oh dear...

She was a mean ol' witch! Oh no! The memories are coming back! What'll we go!? Oooh---what'll we do!?

Perhaps we should tell Master Yen Sid.

Yes. That's what we must do. Hurry!

Maleficent!

Howdy, Sora! How ya doin'?

It's your favorite Gummi engineers here, ready for duty Chip...

...and Dale!

Happy flying!

Only one?

That's no good!

Wait! I think it's a world we know!

Maleficent! Maleficent!

Maybe they really did finish her off.

And this castle sure ain't what I expected. No shine, no nothin'.

Now what's gonna happen to our plan?

It's Hollow Bastion!

Gawrsh, it looks kinda different now.

I hope Leon and the gang are doing okay.

Uh-oh. Looks like we're gonna have to do some fightin'.

Uncle Scrooge!?

Er, who?

He's Donald's uncle---a business typhoon! Before the Heartless showed up, he traveled the worlds on a Gummi Ship with the King. He was helpin' to set up a traffic system.

A transit system!

What's all the racket?

Why, if it isn't Donald! And Goofy! Hello, lads! Aye, you all look hale and hearty!

So do you, Uncle Scrooge.

Ah, if only I were... I canna seem to recreate my favorite old-time ice cream. I'd make millions if I just got it right...

Terrible...!

Hey, what's going on?

That's the town's defense mechanism.

Yuffie!

Look out!

Hey, you guys!

I see you're still in top form.

What'd you expect?

Looks like you're doing okay.

Well, what did YOU expect?

How are the others?

Great!

Hey, Yuffie! Have you seen the King and Riku?

Nope.

But I had a feeling I'd see you guys again.




Is that supposed to be Leon?

Everybody's working on stuff over at Merlin's house. C'mon!

Meet the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee!

We missed you!

Well, if you ain't in top shape.

I knew it.

Knew what?

A while back, everyone suddenly remembered you guys, all at the same time.

You...remembered? Wait! Does that mean you forgot about us!?

Thanks!

So where've you guys been all this time?

We were sleepin'.

Where? In cold storage?

It doesn't matter. This is great. Everyone's together again!

So, um...we're trying to find Riku and the King. Have you seen 'em?

Right.

Sorry. But let us know if there's anything we can do to help. Okay?

Okay. Thanks.

Don't go thankin' us just yet.

Hollow Bastion's got a problem. A big problem.

You mean, like Nobodies? And Heartless?

That's right!

Sounds like you could use our help.

Then let's cut to the chase. Sora, Donald, Goofy. We were hoping the three of you might give us a hand around here.

Like we're gonna say, no?

...I forgot who I'm dealing with.

Hey...what do you mean by that?

Just think of it as a sort of


Follow me to the bailey---there's something you need to see.

Oh! I thought it was you. Right on time!

It's Merlin!

Sora and the gang said they're gonna help out!

Splendid! We'll count on you!

Right!

Ah, yes. Did you give them the cards, dear?

Oh!

Here...they're presents for you. Leon thought you might like to have them.

Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee Honorary Member!

Membership cards!

Kinda cool, huh?

Hey, thanks, Leahhh...huh?

Oh no! We're supposed to be at the bailey!

Just a moment, Sora. What about your magic?

Huh? Oh, that's right...

Maybe you forgot it while you were asleep!

Now, what am I to do with you? I suppose I'll have to lend you a few spells. But be careful with them!

Thanks, Merlin!

To the bailey, and fast!

Look at that.

We want to restore Hollow Bastion to what it used to be. Who knows---maybe even something better. There's still a lot to do, but I'm sure we can handle everything--- Except...for that...

...and that.

We'll handle 'em!

Well, that's good to hear. So Sora---do you know what's going on, then?

There's this guy, Pete, who's been going around plotting with the Heartless. But he's not smart enough to tie his own shoes. The ones we need to worry about are the Nobodies.

And those Organization XIII guys in charge, too!

You called?

You're doing well.

Who's that!?

This calls for a celebration...

The Keyblade...a truly marvelous weapon. Were it only in more...capable hands...

Show yourselves!

Organization XIII!

Good! Now we can settle this!

What a shame... And here I thought we could be friends.

Stop!

What's the big idea!?

Oopsy-daisy!

Move!

Now, do you think that's polite, shutting me down like that?

I said get outta the way! ?????? As if! You can talk all you want, but that won't change a thing.

Then we're gonna MAKE you move!

See, that would work---if I were just any old dude. 'Cept I'm not. I'm with the Organization. Nothing
about me.

Ha! Tough talk for someone who stood on the sidelines while his Nobody flunkeys did the fighting!

Oh, dear. I think you got the wrong impression.

You gonna cry?

As if! Why don't I remind you how tough the crowd you're dealing with really is?

Remind me?

That's RIGHT, he used to give me that same exact look.

I guess you think you can psych me out by saying really random stuff!

Gee... I just don't know.

Be a good boy now!

Wait!

Nuts! He got away!

That was weird. WHO gave him the same look?

Y'know, I think he was just tryin' to confuse ya.

Yeah, you're right. Only one me!

The Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee Honorary Member---

Huh?

What's this?

Gawrsh, ya think...?

Ohh...now I get it. That must've been the gate Yen Sid talked about.

Oh boy!

Sorry to run, Leon, but other worlds are calling.

Organization XIII... They look tough. Be careful out there.

See ya soon.

Do my eyes deceive me? Does he really have the power to wield the Keyblade. He's nothing but a boy.

Give him a chance. It means he's straight as an arrow.
He's pure of heart, unlike all of us here.

He'd better be, or else he's worthless.

I truly hope he's enjoying himself on his adventure.

Maybe he'd like a hand to determine his fate.

Hey, as long as it works in our favor! We can let him do what he wants for now. Then we'll all jump in if needed!

Those are bold words coming from you. Are you saying you'll volunteer to take care of it if things go wrong?

Huh? What?! Me?! No, you have the wrong guy... I'm not comfortable with that.

You act as though you have a conscience... When was the last time any one of us felt anything?

Truer words were never spoken.
Well, I suppose, the fun will have to wait.

Do you know what happens to those who lose their true purpose? Inevitably, they destroy themselves.

Gentlemen.

The hero of the Keyblade has embarked on a new adventure. Make sure it is one he will remember. Now, go.

Hey! What happened to Twilight Town?

It's gone!

See that, Mulan? It's Shan-Yu, leader of the Hun army! C'mon, girl. This is your big chance!

I can see it now
You gonna be famous! I'm talkin' A-list!

Mushu, I'm not sure... I haven't even joined the army yet. I have to take my father's place to preserve the Fa family honor. I just hope I don't get discovered.

Whatever. You just scared---admit it.

Aren't you?

A Heartless?

Let's get the jump on 'im!

Gawrsh, maybe we better look before we leap.

Is that Mushu?

That's right, I know you heard of me! I'm little, lethal, and legendary! Now y'all scram before I get my dragon dander up!

Hey, Mushu! We missed you!

Yeah, well you better HOPE I miss YOU, or else you're---you're...Sora! Donald! Goofy!

Do you know them?

Know them? Man, we used to kick all kinds of bad guy butt together! Yeah, you know, I helped these guys out of a lot of tight spots. 'Cause I'm a mighty dragon! Right?

Something like that. And...you are?

I'm Mulan. Um, no, I-I mean...

Ping!

Mulan Ping?

Just...Ping. I am Ping, son of Fa Zhou.

You know Mushu?

Mushu's one of my family's guardians.

We didn't know we were borrowin' somebody as important as a family guardian.

Yeah, that's right!

And that puts you three up to your eyeballs in debt to Ping here.

Well, guess what, kiddies? It's payback time!

Mushu...

Ah, they don't mind. Ain't that right?

Hmm, sounds fair.

See, Ping here was just on his way to join the Imperial army.

We gotta go find the other recruits over at the training camp.

Would you join us? It'll be easier to fit in if I'm with guys, like you.

What do you mean,
?

Well, um, uh, don't---don't worry about that.

You're pretendin' to be a boy, aren't ya?

You're a...girl?

You didn't notice?

Uh-uh.

Not me.

I think it's working.

I don't know---those two would fall for anything.

I'm right here!

Hey!

Remember, girl---manly!

'Bout time we got some grub.

Hey, no cutting!

Get out!

Back off!

Uh-oh!

Hey, a space in line!

I wonder what they're serving for lunch today.

Knuckle sandwiches!

That does it!

Please!

Please!

What a girl!

Uh...knock it off!

Knock what off?

You punched me!

Cutting in line!

What a shrimp!

Who you callin' a shrimp, panda lips? I'm a bona fide guardian dragon!

L-let's just get back in line, okay?

Whose side are you on? I just got slugged!

Want some more?

Soldiers! Get back in line!

The Captain!

What are they?

Heartless!

Oh yeah?

Ping, I hope you're ready!

You three. What are your names?

Sora.

Donald.

Goofy.

You're welcome in my troop. Your battle skills are encouraging.

I am the son of Fa Zhou---

You should return home.

B-but... That would dishonor my family!

You'd rather dishonor my troops?

Don't make me---!

If Ping trains hard and does his best, he'll get stronger in no time.

Hmm...

Just give us an assignment! We'll show you how well we can work together.

So...you want to be tested? Our orders are to ambush Shan-Yu's army on their way here. They should be coming through the mountain pass.

We'll smash them!

I doubt that. You four will be the advance party. Scout out the mountain for my troops.

That's it? No problem. Right?

R-right.

I'll brief you on the details later. Return when you're ready to depart. Remember, the smallest mission may have the greatest purpose. Stay alert!

Sir!

Have you decided you're up for a mission? A strange figure was seen at the Checkpoint! Head there quickly and defeat the enemy!

You've done a passable job. But stay alert! This is just the beginning. Shan-Yu has invaded our country. We must stop him at all costs. A mob is heading for the Checkpoint. Stop them while keeping an eye out for strange enemies!

Hmm, not bad. Now brace yourself for the rest of your assignments. Our objective is to defeat Shan-Yu. Do not fail your mission. It seems the enemy has invaded the camp. Defeat every enemy you encounter!

Yes, that's exactly what I need from you. Now, you still have some tasks to do. Stay sharp. You did well.

I knew it!

Captain...

I suppose you've made a little progress...

Not a little---a lot!

No. You're right, Captain. Please give me one more assignment. This time I'll show you what I'm truly made of!

I'll give you one more chance. See me when you're ready to depart. Remember, this may be a test, but it's still an important mission. Be alert!

Sir!

Your mission is to secure the path over the summit so our company can pass. I've authorized you to be let through to the summit. Don't let me down!

Hey, you ain't half bad.

A man among men!

Thanks!

But the Captain...

Captain!

Ping sure did great!

You bet he did!

Hmm...Fine. I'll let you join my troops... But I'm still not convinced you have what it takes to be a worthy soldier.

Why not!?

It's all right, Sora. I'll find a way to show him what I'm made of. Just give me a chance.

That's the spirit, Ping.

Sir!

Good going, Ping!

Thanks!

Okay, girl! Here's your chance! I just saw this real shady guy. And I know it's Shan-Yu.

Shan-Yu!?

That's the Hun leader! We've got to tell the Captain!

Right!

Waaaait wait-wait-wait WAIT! Everybody use their heads a sec. Now, why are we here? To make the Captain see Mulan's---I mean, Ping's talents and bring honor to her family.

So, let's go find out where Shan-Yu is, by ourselves. Then, if we're lucky, we can fry him up good! Though just tracking the guy down should earn us our stars... Captain Musclehead will have to notice my girl!

Okay. Let's go.

We'll help out.

Now we're cookin'! Shan-Yu is in a cave outside the village!

Dead end.

There's nobody here...

You're crazy. Check again!

Oh, well...

Wait for me, Donald!

Hey, wait up!

Huh?

What? What is it?

Sora!

Ping!

Nice fighting, Ping! You were amazing.

You okay?

Yeah, thanks to Ping.

C'mon! Time to report to the Captain!

But Shan-Yu wasn't here.

Please! That Hun is old news! We're gonna tell the Captain how thousands of Heartless stormed the cave, and Ping took out almost every one of 'em!

Captain!

Don't overdo it, Captain!

It's just a scratch.

Captain, the enemy! Where did they go?

They went toward the summit...

We'll stop them!

It kinda is our fault.

Right.

You mean MY fault.

Uh-uh!

Shan-Yu and the Heartless did this, not us! Captain, if you track down the villagers, we'll handle this.

Let's go.

Attack!

Stand back!

We'll handle this!

Sorry!

Oh, a flint, flint, I need so---huh...

Me, hey, whoa! Whoa! Wait a second! Ah!

You're going the wrong way!

Yes!

Captain?

Look out!

Run for it!

Thanks, Ping.

It...was nothing.

I should never have doubted you. From now on, you have my trust.

Thank you, Captain.

First she uses me as a lighter, then she turns me into a cannon ball. The head ancestor's gonna hear about this. You know, that's it! I give up! I can't take this no more. C'mon, Mulan. Let's quit this charade and go home, girl.

Mushu!

Huh?

Mulan? A woman? It can't be!

Ping! Captain!

Oh boy, you're okay!

You all knew, didn't you? You knew Ping was really a woman in disguise.

I can't believe you lied to me. The punishment for high treason and dishonoring the Army...is death. Get out of my sight...now. You're all dismissed.

But Captain...

My debt is repaid.

The Emperor is waiting! Move out!

Mulan... I blew it.

Thank you, everyone. Sorry I got you in trouble.

It's no big deal. So Ping... I mean, uh, Mulan...what're you gonna do now?

Go back home.

You know, your daddy's gonna be steamed as a chicken dumpling.

Relax, we'll take our share of the blame.

Thanks. You're all wonderful friends.

Shan-Yu!

He's alive!

He's heading for the Imperial City! We've got to warn Shang!

---Shang!

Shan-Yu is alive! He's headed this way!

And why should I believe you this time?

But...she's telling you the truth!

Guard the palace! Do not let the enemy get anywhere near the Emperor!

That's an order!

Captain! We'll secure the courtyard, and you can save the Emperor!

That's an order!

The Emperor's in danger!

No time to lose!

Now you'll bow to me!

It ends now!

Right now!

Now that's what I call burning some hunny-bun! Aw, yeah! Mulan's the best! Mulan's the best! No, wait a minute---I'm the best! Mushu's the best! Mushu's the best!

I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.

You stole your father's armor, ran away from home, impersonated an Imperial soldier. You deceived your commanding officer, shamed the entire Chinese army, and dishonored your family name.

We get the picture...

You're a young woman. And in the end...

...you have saved us all.

Your Excellency!

Captain Li?

Take this, so the world will know what it is you have done for China.

Thank you.

Mulan.

Yes?

Sora.

Sir.

Donald.

Wak!

Goofy.

Yes, sir.

Thank you.


? Is that all there is to say, Captain? If you wish to win the heart of Fa Mulan, China's bravest woman, you'll have to be a bit more eloquent than that!

Can I get an autograph?

Thanks for everything, Sora.

Now they GOTTA let me go back to bein' a guardian! They GOTTA!

But Mushu, I thought you already WERE a family guardian!

What? Oh, no, no---don't even worry about that, that's just real technical. Just for us guardians.

You tricked us!

No, no no no, see I did---I just, uh...

You know, I just didn't wanna bog y'all down with all the Guardian-ese. See, it's very complex, a lot of fine print. You wouldn't understand.

Huh?

Okay!

Guess it's about time to be movin' on.

You shall be missed.

Is it okay if we come back to visit?

Of course!

We will look forward to your return.

You two play nice.

Whoa... Watch it, soldier!

Goodbye, Sora, Donald, Goofy!

Hey, what is this place?

It's huge!

And sorta gloomy, don't ya think?

I wonder who lives here.

Hey, does anybody else recognize that?

Hey! That's the Beast!

Yeah.

Maybe we should check up on him.

Look!

C'mon!

Where did it go?

Found it!

Aw, c'mon! Enough already!

Somebody help us!

Just in time!

Gee, do ya think he maybe forgot who we are?

With this many Heartless around, something must be up.

Why'd he have to do that?

What is it?

I just know I saw a lady at the top of those stairs...

Well... If the Beast is here in the castle, that lady musta been Belle, right?

Yeah, maybe so. Belle might know what's happened to the Beast, too.

C'mon! Let's go find her!

Shhh!

What am I going to do?

Okay.

Donald!

Hey! Who opened the door?

Oh, I'm so happy you're here!

Donald! Sora! Goofy!

Hiya!

Put me down! Put me down!

Where's the Beast?

Oh, he must be in the west wing. We don't talk like we used to.

Did something happen?

Yes. Isn't that why you're here?

Not exactly. But we can still help!

Since we're here and all.

The Beast won't talk to you?

He's been acting strange lately. The only ones who might know why are locked up in the dungeon. I want to help them, but...

Wait a second. Who locked who up?

The Beast locked up his servants.

But why?

That's what I don't know.

Hmm. Where's this dungeon?

You can get to the undercroft from the west hall. The dungeon is down there.

West hall. Got it.

Be careful!

There should be a way into the undercroft around here...

Here it is!

Do you MIND!?

And I was just starting to get comfortable... May I help you?

Huh? What? Oh, right---Belle needs us to go to the dungeon.

Goodness! You're here to help my friends? Well, why didn't you say so?

Er...

I'm sorry I startled you. Oh, I used to be human, you know, until the enchantress cast her spell. I was turned into a wardrobe when the prince was turned into a beast.

The prince is the Beast!?

The Beast is a prince!?

That's right. Although his behavior was far from princely at the time.

What's this about a...spell?

Well, it was a cold winter's night...

And that's enough for now. You can hear the rest when you've rescued the others. It'll give you something to look forward to.

Aww...

Hurry, now. The dungeon is damp and chilly. Certainly no place for a clock!

A clock?

You'll find out soon enough.

All right. Let's get going.

This must be it.

Uh-oh!

You think the dungeon's past this door?

C'mon, we gotta set those servants free!

He's right. Let's go.

There's nobody here.

You mean there's nobody to rescue?

Did someone say
?

Shhh! Keep quiet. It might be THEM.

Oh, they look like nice boys to me.

We are nice. We're your friends.

Yeah. Belle sent us to find you.

I'm Sora. Donald. Goofy.

...D-don't touch! I-I am self-winding, sir!

I'm glad you're okay.

It is we who are overjoyed to see you!

Did somebody put a spell on you guys, too?

Yes, that's right! You've heard! It was the enchantress.

It seems so long ago...

It was a cold winter's night... An old beggar woman came to the castle, and asked for shelter.

But the master of this castle, that is of course, the Prince...

Stop that! Put me down this instant!

Thank you!

The master turned her away. All because of her, ahem, meager appearance.

That's awful!

Oui. He was a spoiled prince, so selfish and...how shall I say...cruel.

Lumiere!

The old woman warned our master not to be deceived by appearances... Still, he would not take her in.

Then the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress.

She turned the Prince into a beast, a shape she thought fitting for his cold heart.

And to further punish him, everyone in the castle was enchanted, too.

Wow... That's quite a story.

Is there anything we can do to help?

Let's get the enchantress!

Oh no, dear.

We already know what needs to be done, but with the master out of sorts...

He sure is acting weird.

It's almost as if he's forgotten how to trust others.

You don't suppose he's been turned into a Heartless, do you?

Heartless!?

If they're a part of this, then it's a good thing we're here.

Let's go find the Beast!

Splendid!

Follow me, messieurs. I know a shortcut.

Allow our guests to pass!

After you.

I'm afraid we won't be marching out that easily. You see, the door leading to the other side is concealed by a sort of contraption.

What kind of contraption?

Observe.

The lantern came down!

Indeed it did. If we could but light all the lanterns in this passage the secret door would open...

But, as you can see, the lanterns are already burning---with an enchanted flame.

You must put out this enchanted flame before I am able to light the lanterns properly.

Can't ya just throw some water on 'em?

I'm afraid that's not enough. But if you use the power of light...

Hmm... How about I try using the Keyblade?

Bravo!

Only three lanterns left! If we work together, we'll have that door open in no time!

Piece of cake!

Again, it is not quite so simple, mon ami. Certainly you cannot expect Cogsworth to hang from that handle forever?

What? Why? Lumiere! You---

If he gets tired and falls off, all the unlit lanterns will rise to the ceiling again.

Before you can continue, you must see to Cogsworth. Once he gets his strength back, he'll grasp the lever again for you.

Let's give it a shot!

Are we all set?

Oui. The secret door should open now.

But I don't see any secret door.

No need to worry. Just push that block over there---the one that's sticking out.

Got it.

Now, I must check on the castle. I fear my absence has been too long.

I'd best be off, too, dears.

Watch out for the Heartless!

The master's room is at the very end of the west wing. I shall go on ahead and wait for you.

It's time you dealt with Belle. She's scheming to take everything you have. This castle, your precious rose. And then---your life. Trust no one. Feed your anger! Only anger will keep you strong.

I've had enough of strength. There's only one thing I want---

What? To love, and be loved in return? Who could ever love a beast?

See? She has accomplices.

Hey, Prince!

Oh dear! Master!

Please, Master! Please! Compose yourself!

Cogsworth...what happened?

Well, Master...ah, you see...that is... How shall I say...ah, actually...mmm...

Well, you put everybody down there in that dungeon!

I did what?

Ah...you did!

Who was that guy you were talking to? The one in black?

Xaldin... that's his name. He came from the darkness... He...used my anger to control me. He took all my sorrow, my sadness, my pain---and turned it all into rage. There was nothing I could do... I could no longer see the truth.

Well, I'll be. That must be why you threw all of your friends down there into the dungeon. You wanted to make sure that you didn't hurt 'em, right?

Was that it? Was it to protect them?

Sure. We know you're good inside.

He's right, Master. We've all seen how kind you can be. After all... Belle can see the goodness in your heart, but I'm afraid you've yet to---

Belle!

I've mistreated her... I've mistreated her and been so selfish.

She didn't say anything about that.

She'd never tell anyone of my cruelty... She's too good.

You see, I'm afraid he judges himself far too harshly.

Why don't you just go talk to her?

But...

No excuses! C'mon, we'll go with you.

Master!

Everybody's safe now.

Wonderful! Thank you!

Where is Belle?

Why, she left in a hurry. Something about going after this...man in black.

WHAT!? Why doesn't she do as she's told?

Temper, temper! Her spirit is what makes Belle so special.

We'd better go find her!

I'm warning you! You'll be sorry!

Belle! Where are you?

Beast! Help! I'm in the ballroom!

Belle!

I'm all right!

We did it!

So you think.

Xaldin!

Farewell.

What does he want here?

He must be with Organization XIII. Ever heard of the Nobodies? When a strong-hearted person turns into a Heartless, a Nobody's created, too. See, the Organization...they've got control of all the Nobodies.

That's right. And they were gonna make you into a Heartless. That way, they could get that Nobody of yours and have control over it.

You're alright!

Belle!

Belle... I-I'm sorry---I...wasn't myself. I hope I haven't done anything to hurt you.

Forgive me.

I know you weren't yourself. You don't have to apologize. But I had hoped...that you might have changed a little bit.

I wish you could start trusting me.

Oh, I am afraid time is running short.

What do you mean?

Remember the rose?

From the Beast's room?

Precisely. You see, if the master can learn to love, and earn love in return, before the last petal falls...

...the spell will be broken.

Really? You think he's gonna make it?

We think so.

Yep, I think you're right.

I HOPE you're right...

What happened?

The gate is open!

Do you have to go?

Yeah.

Now, no more arguin', okay?

We'll see to it.

Take care, dears.

You're welcome here anytime.

If you hear anything about Riku or the King, the Heartless, the Organization---anything at all---let us know!

Okay, gotta go!

Bye bye!

Huh?

Hey, wait a minute... Is the ship moving all on its own?

Yup! Looks like we're headed toward Hollow Bastion.

I wonder what's up.

Uh-oh!

C'mon!

Well, now...took your time, did you?

Oh, was it you who summoned us, Merlin?

Yes, yes... But it seems I used too much power in doing so, and those infernal Heartless...

So, what's up?

Well, I happened to stumble across this in the Zero District.

Pooh's storybook!

That's right. I know you're a good friend of Winnie the Pooh, Sora---that's why I summoned you. And when I did, I was attacked by the Heartless. Of course, I fought back with some rather powerful magic, but then I began to fear the book would be damaged, so I... Oh! Now, just a moment. Leon and the others need to hear this too. I-I'd better go find them. Be back in a jiffy.

I wonder how Pooh's doing.

Wanna find out?

Yeah!

Sora...

Cover for me, okay?

I wonder if Pooh's home.

Hey, Pooh Bear! How you doing? Finding enough honey lately?

Oh, yes. In fact, I was just about to do my stoutness exercises. Would you like to join me, Sora?

Sure, I'm game!

Huh?

Sora! Hurry up!

Donald?

Did ya bring the book, Sora?

Hey!

Give that back!

Think it's okay?

Gawrsh, maybe ya better go back and make sure Pooh's all right.

But what about Merlin?

Well, I guess we could explain...

Great!

Pooh!

I'm so glad you're okay, Pooh.

And I'm glad you came to visit. But you see, I was just about to begin my stoutness exercises. Perhaps we could visit a bit later...Somebody-I-Don't-Know.

Oh...sure.

So...how's Piglet these days?

I don't think I know anyone by that name. Now where was I? Oh, yes. My stoutness exercises.

Pooh? Hey! Pooh?

Something very weird is happening here. Maybe I'd better go back and ask Merlin about this.

Couldn't be bothered to wait up for an old wizard, eh?

Sorry about that...

How are things in there?

Well... Pooh seems to have forgotten all about me. And not just me---all his other friends, too.

I was afraid of that...

I suspect it has something to do with those pages the Heartless stole. You'll have to collect the torn pages and repair the book to put things right. This book is one of the world's most cherished elements. I'd been meaning to tell Leon I'd found it, but perhaps we should keep it between us for now.

We will!

Good, good... Now, the book isn't all that's cherished... This is for you, Sora.

What is it?

Simply concentrate on it with all your heart, and you need only say the word to summon an ally who will help in times of need.

Like Simba and Mushu did, the last time we were here?

Precisely. Now go forth, with your friends by your side!

Thanks, Merlin. We're worried about Pooh, so we'll be back once we've found those torn pages.

Huh?

Are ya sure this is the coliseum?

It's that way!

Oh... Guess we were a little off.

Heartless!

Thanks, but...I'm fine.

And you're supposed to be?

I'm Sora, he's Donald, and that's Goofy. We came to see how Hercules is doing.

You know Wonderboy?

Yeah, 'cause we're heroes, too!

Ya mean, junior heroes, Donald.

Looks like we have a friend in common. Name's Megara. My friends call me Meg.

So how's Herc?

Wonderboy? Well, he's duking it out at the Coliseum every day. You know,
and all that. He's ready to drop, but he keeps on fighting. Even Wonderboy has his limits, though. These opponents are bad news---special deliveries from Hades himself...

Hades!?

Right. Lord of the Underworld. I was on my way to see him. Maybe I can get Hades to give Wonderboy a breather. If anything happens to that kid...

Gawrsh... Sounds like you're more than just friends!

Oh...uh, I mean...

We'll go have a little talk with Hades. I'd hate for anything to happen to you on your way to see him.

You really want to do that? Well, it looks like you know what you're doing. I guess I'll take you up on that offer. But...let's keep this whole chat-with-Hades thing our little secret, okay?

Our lips are sealed!

The Organization!

Yeah.

Run! Run away!

Okay...?

Where do they dig these freaks up? Geez, Louise.

Oh, they're nuttin' but trouble, the whole lot of 'em. So, uh...what're you gonna do about Hercules? He's made mince meat outta every fighter you sent at him. Pretty soon the Underworld's gonna be standing room only. Say, why don't you just pick somebody already dead and save him the trouble?

Dead... Dead is good! And I know just the warrior.

I'm scared too, Donald.

Hades, come out!

By the by, uh... What's down there?

Just the Underworld's deepest dungeon. This time I'm bringing out the mother of all bad guys.

You don't say. Well... Maybe I should go.

Let's cut to the chase. Here's the deal I'm gonna offer you. I let you out of the slammer---no strings---you'll be free as a bird.

And all for one little job. Fight Hercules, in the Coliseum...to the death!

This is my story. And you're not part of it.

Did you forget who you're talking to? I am the Lord of the Dead!

No wonder no one wants to die.

You are FIRED!

Hades!

You again?

Fight!


Get up!

Something's wrong!

I feel kinda funny...

That's right! See, that's the thing. In the Underworld, heroes are zeroes---comes with the territory.

Go now!

But I've gotta talk to Hades!

What was that?

We can't fight him here! We have to go---now!

Is he gone?

Don't count on it.

Huh?

Leaving so soon?

You're really good. Are you some kind of hero?

No, I'm no hero... I'm just an...

Huh?

Auron.

My name.

I'm Sora.

Donald.

Goofy!

It seems we were fated to meet. Maybe you need a guardian.

Guardian? Thanks, but no thanks.

I got Heartless all over the Underworld now. So you can leave those pipsqueaks to me. Look, pal, you just keep working on turning Hercules into a Heartless. Then he'll be all mine.

This is my underworld, you idiot!

I'll handle this MYSELF!

Cerberus, go!

What? It's closed!

Come on, open!

Will that open it?

Yeah. I think so.

Hurry!

Uh...

Sora wait!

Come on!

Come on, Wonderboy, play hooky for a day. For old time's sake?

They came to see me. They came to see a hero. I can't let them down.

Don't worry, Meg. I'll be fine. What does a hero need rest for, huh?

See ya!

Sora, don't let me down.

Whew...

Huh?

What happened to Auron?

He can take care of himself. Let's go find Meg. Then we can try this again.

Let me see if I got this right... That brat's Keyblade works on any lock?

That's right.

Have I ever told you about the killer coliseum we have right here in the Underworld? It makes the one upstairs look like an Olympic kiddie pool.

Then that's the place we're gonna put an end to Herc the Jerk's winnin' streak.

Problem. Zeus locked it tight.

Bingo... All we gotta do is swipe that key...and then reopen the Underdrome!

Hate to tell ya, but that key is kinda particular. It won't work for just anybody. And that kid ain't no pushover.

I think this calls for a woman's touch.

Gawrsh, this sure does bring back memories!


Sora! Donald! Goofy! When'd you get here?

Hey, Herc!

Hi!

Howdy there!

You on another adventure?

Yeah, trackin' down some friends, wipin' out some Heartless.

Junior heroes, always busy!

You know it!

So, did you find those friends of yours?

Still working on it. When we got here, we ran into Meg---meg-mega trouble, I mean! So we had to help somebody out. We tried to go teach Hades a thing or two...but the Underworld drains away all our strength. Don't suppose you have any ideas?

Well, there is a stone that guards against the Underworld's curse. The gods on Mount Olympus use it whenever they have to go down there.

Think we could use it?

Sure, why not! I'll go get it for you.

Thanks!

Real nice of you!

But Hades is no pushover, even if you've got the Olympus Stone. And I have a match today, so I can't go with you... Know what you need? Training! Why don't you go talk to Phil?

Hey, good idea!

Hey champ, how ya feeling? Better rest up for tomorrow's match. Nobody's gonna pay to see a worn-out hero...capiche? Remember what I told you. Victory in the games comes down to two simple words Eat, bathe, sleep!

Hey, if it ain't the junior heroes!

Lookin' good, Phil.

Never better! How you guys been? Have you earned your
wings yet?

Nope, you ain't got what it takes.

So, what's up?

Ha ha ha! You three are gonna take on Hades?

What's so funny!?

You got nerve. I like that. Hey, you never know---stranger things have happened, right? Better get cracking, boys! So you want to train, eh? All right, I'm gonna work you hard!

How was THAT?

It ain't over yet, kid! There's more on the menu. You can relax once you've finished ALL the training.

No problem!

Now get ready for the real thing. If a big one appears, don't let it get away.

Listen, I gotta take off for a bit.

Where to?

None of your beeswax.

Sorry, guys... The Olympus Stone has been stolen.

What!?

By who?

We don't know who did it yet. All we're sure of is that it was a guy in a black-hooded cloak. And he had accomplices---a bunch of creatures in white.

Someone you know?

I think so. Hey, if we can get the Olympus Stone back, can we borrow it for a while?

Sure. By the way, you haven't seen Meg around, have you?

Oh, okay...

What's wrong, your hero-ness? Feeling under the weather?

You know, I though staying in perfect shape was part of the hero job description...you know what I'm saying?

Oh, right... Hades, we gotta talk!

I came to share a bit of mildly-interesting news

Seems your dear, sweet little Nutmeg...

...went and got herself lost in the Underworld.

You mean you kidnapped her!

Well, maybe... But why get caught up in the details?

Uh-uh-uh! You can't leave now, okay?

You've got a very important match today, against, um... the bloodthirsty Hydra! I mean, if you don't stick around, who knows what kind of
might happen.

Yeah, accidents you cause.

Like I said details, who needs 'em?

You're just a coward.

Ah well. Can't all be heroes.

Can you handle this?

You got it! We're heroes!

Junior heroes, Donald.

You take care of the Hydra. We'll handle the rest.

I'm counting on you.

You gotta find Meg!

Phil!

Ooh, ohh...

What happened?

I spotted this strange guy all dressed in black. I chased after him, but he turned on me. Next thing I know, I'm seeing stars.

All dressed in black!?

He's the one who stole the Olympus Stone.

Where did he run off to?

To the Underworld. He's a bad apple, all right. And all I wanted was to find a backup hero. Just in case Herc needed to take a break.

Heroes, eh? You could've just asked!

You know someone!?

Oh, good one...

Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

Heh, thanks! Thank you! Hope you enjoyed it!

Man... This Underworld curse is really getting to me.

We've got to get that Olympus Stone back fast!

Huh? Ah! You!

Wait a sec... Roxas?

Excuse me?

Roxas? Oh, it's no use.

Huh? What are you talking about?

Let's see, here...
... Right. Did they ever pick the wrong guy for this one...

You're bizarre...

He's gotta be the thief!

Now that's just plain rude!

Dance, water! Dance!

Not bad, Roxas!

Roxas, come back to us!

Guy's a broken record.

Hey, look!

Let's go! Meg needs our help!

Meg!

Almost there.

Now that's what I call a key. Gee, thanks for your help! Now have a nice day.

Sora, behind you!

What's wrong? Can't fight in the Underworld? Ohh, boo-hoo-hoo!

Better think again!

Charge!

There's too many!

Let's go!

Sorry I'm late.

Get Meg outta here. I'll meet you back at the Coliseum.

What about you?

I'm gonna show these guys what happens when they mess with a true hero.

Now, wait a sec!

Sora...I won't leave him.

He'll be okay.

Look, even Herc has his limits. He can't keep winning forever.

Then we'll go back him up.

Get Meg outta here!

This place gives me the creeps. I'll deal with you nitwits next time!

Could today possibly get any better? This time Wonder-breath is going down for good.

Well, if it isn't everyone's favorite hero washout. You really blew it this time.

No one likes a sore loser, Hades.

Can it, keyboy!

Then let me.

No one likes a sore loser, Hades.

Yeah, yeah, Styx and stones. Hey, maybe you should go check on that Hydra you neglected to finish off. I hear things are really FALLING APART up there, champ.

Wait!

Hate to run, but I've got another little diversion to attend to.

This can't be...

Champ! You're safe!

I failed...

It's not your fault!

I left everyone unprotected.

Hades was right. I'm just a...a washout.

Aw, come on, champ! I didn't train you to think like that.

Wonderboy...

Phil's right. This is no time to beat yourself up.

I'm some hero...

Herc needs help!

Yeah!

Don't suppose you got room for one more?

We're in!

I let you down. I'm just...no use.

It's not your fault. Hey, even a god would be exhausted.

She's right. Give yourself a chance to rest.

There won't be any games for a while, anyway.

Don't worry about Wonderboy here. I'll look after him. Sora, Donald, Goofy, I owe you big time.

Hey, it's no big deal. Just let us know if Hades or the Heartless start acting up. We'll take care of it.

Yeah, that's what heroes are for!

When did you three make hero?

Let's save that for another time... We have to hit the road.

Okay. Don't be strangers.

Gawrsh, I hope ya feel better soon, Hercules.

Yeah...

Phil?

Oh, well, take care you guys! Stay a little longer next time. We got some serious training to catch up on.

Well, time to go. Oh, I almost forgot. The Olympus Stone.

And where is everyone else?

Beats me. They musta had some other matters to deal with.


?

You mean they have more important affairs to attend to than my return?

Well, see, there's this Organization XIII that keeps gettin' in the way---

Let those fools play their little game!

But what about that runt with the Keyblade? He's been a real pain, too.

Oh, has he? Very well then. I suppose you'd best tell me what's happened during my absence.

Oh...hmm. Now I wonder where that old album could be.

Queen Minnie!

It's horrible!

Somethin's wrong in the Hall of the Cornerstone!

There's real sharp thorns everywhere!

Oh, King Mickey, I wish you could hear me. The castle is in danger! We've got to do something soon! Donald... Goofy... Where are you?

This is your castle... Must be nice to be home, huh? Well...

Ya know, somethin' just don't feel quite right...

Yeah.

You're back!

Move it! Let's go!

Queen Minnie needs to see you!

The castle's in danger! Hurry! To the library!

Your Majesty! Queen Minnie! We're back!

You're here!

Your Royal Highness, did ya happen to summon us?

Yes.

Where's the King?

Excuse him. This is our friend, Sora.

Oh, Sora! The King told me all about you in his letters. He said you're a very brave young man.

So, do you know where he is?

Your Majesty, what are Heartless doing in your castle?

Oh my... So those are the Heartless.

Don't worry, we'll take care of 'em!

I know I can count on you, Sora. Now, there's something I'd like all of you to come and see. Would you please escort me to the audience chamber?

I forgot to warn everyone else in the castle about the danger! We must be sure they're hidden somewhere safe!

Okay, we'll go tell them!

The whole castle!?

We just gotta split up, Donald.

I'll make sure that everyone knows what's going on.

No, Sora, you'll just get lost!

Okay. Then I'll stay with the Queen.

Good.

All righty then, see ya later!

Um, the audience chamber, right, ma'am?

Yes, Sora. Let's be on our way.

Just one moment.

As soon as the trouble started, I made sure to seal this room.

Now then...shall we?

Not here, too!

I got 'em.

Come on, gimme a break!

Huh?

Whoa...

The room below is called the 'Hall of the Cornerstone.' Our castle has always been safe from worlds that are evil...thanks to the Cornerstone of Light which we keep down there.

The Cornerstone...of light?

This is the castle's cherished Cornerstone. But look. The thorns... They must be the work of someone very evil. I wonder what this could mean...

Maleficent!

No way!

Well, well, well. What have we here...? If it isn't the wretched Keyblade holder, and his pitiful lackeys!

What!? Now you're gonna deal with me!

All in good time. I promise you'll be able to partake of my vengeance. But you must be patient.

Just what are you doing here, Maleficent!?

Ah, Queen Minnie. Radiant, as always.

I'm here on a property venture. I want this castle for my own. However, it's a bit too
for what I have in mind. I suppose I'll just have to fill every room with my personal touch of darkness.

You'd better stop right now if you know what's good for you!

Ooh, how frightening. Very well. I'll stop... Just as soon as the castle belongs to me!

What a hag.

Nothing like this has ever happened before. I looked through all the records in the library, but I couldn't find a single clue.

Ohhh! We should go ask somebody who knows lotsa stuff that ain't in any book!

Merlin the Wizard!

Yes! That's perfect! Merlin just might know something about this mess. Let's ask his advice!

We saw him in Hollow Bastion, right?

Yeah. Let's go!

Anybody home?

Merlin!

The castle's in danger!

What is all that racket? Ho-ho! I thought---oh, it's you! It looks like you've learned a bit since the last time I saw you.

Really!?

Wait a minute! Let's talk about the problem! It's Maleficent! She's back!

Where? Inside the castle!?

Yep! And Heartless, too.

Oh, dear...

Maleficent wants to take over the whole castle...

There's Heartless in every part of the castle! The Queen is in danger! What!?

Perhaps, I'd better just see for myself.

Mm-hmm...interesting...

What's happening, Merlin?

This is not good. In fact, I'm afraid, it's quite serious.

What's that?

My boy, that is a gateway to a special world. Someone in that world is responsible for what's going on in this castle. Of that, I'm certain.

Oh boy!

We knew we could count on you, Merlin!

Then we should go get him!

Wait a moment! The perpetrators must be stopped, of course. But there's something else to do first. Somewhere in that world, there should be another door that's identical to this one. I believe our enemies are utilizing that door. As long as it remains open, the castle will be in grave danger. Listen carefully, Sora. You must find that door. And when you do---lock it with your Keyblade.

Got it.

You can count on us!

Now, one more thing. You're heading into a very special world. While you're there, the nature of that world may tempt you to do something dark. You must resist that temptation at all costs!

What do you mean?

You'll know soon enough. I have faith in you, my lads!

Hey, look! There's the Cornerstone of Light!

What's going on? Everything's black and white.

Hey, this is kinda like...um...uh...

Deja vu?

Yeah, that's it!

Really? Have you been here before?

Hey you! Seen any bad guys around here?

Why I oughta... Bah! I don't have time to waste on punks like you! So, I guess I'll go easy on ya!

Well, there's our villain.

What's with you squirts? You got some kinda bone to pick with me?

More than one!

Them's fighting words!

Huh?

Not so fast!

Yeah!

What's that for?

What's you punks' beef with me anyway? Hmm... Who are ya? You new around here?

Cut the act.

Whoa!

Ooh, ow!

You know, somethin' doesn't seem quite right here. Are you sure you're Pete?

Well, of COURSE I'm Pete. I'm the captain of the steamboat. So stop botherin' me, see?

So hit the road! I gotta go find the little runt what stole my boat!

Gawrsh, maybe we made a mistake.

I'm starting to think the same thing. He hasn't even called any Heartless.

Sorry we attacked ya like that, Capt'n Pete.

Oh yeah? Well, if you're really sorry, then go find my steamboat.

Y-yes sir!

Ooh, my achin' back.

I thought for sure Pete was the bad guy.

Aw, that would be too easy.

C'mon, fellas. Let's try to find that steamboat.

I guess we DID say we would...

Hey, we've got a door to find!

Oh, yeah!

I don't see any doors.

Huh? What's this?

I can't see a thing...

Hey, look! There's the Cornerstone of Light!

What's going on? Everything's black and white.

Hey, this is kinda like...um...uh...

Deja vu?

Yeah, that's it!

Really? Have you been here before?

What was that?

Heartless goin' out...

...and us, coming in.

What does it mean?

Let's get rid of those Heartless!

Then what'll we do?

We'll worry about that later!

What're they building?

Look out!

The King!

Gee, he seems kinda different somehow...

Heartless! I knew it! You really saved the day!

Now, let's get those Heartless!

How'd you like that?

Hey, look!

You absolute idiot! You've managed to fail at everything! And what's more...you foolishly thought you could take my place while I was away. Well, as of now, you're finished. Mark my words, there'll be no place for you when our time comes!

Useless imbecile...

But-but...but I...

What---?

Somebody sure was angry.

I don't understand.

Let's just try to clear out the Heartless first. This place is okay, but we've got three more spots to check.

What!?

The town's shrunk!

Or do ya think maybe we got bigger?

Hey! Look at the toy cannons!

What's he saying?

Hey! There're Heartless!

Man, that was weird!

Look, Sora! Over there!

Aw, for cryin' out loud...she didn't have to go and say that. Okay, I mighta messed up every now and then. But I'm a lot more things than useless... Why, when I was startin' out...

Oh...I miss those good ol' days... What I wouldn't give to go back in time...
What I wouldn't give...

Huh?

Hey! I think that's my...

A door?

It looks familiar...

Yup---it's the door Merlin magic'd up!

So it should come straight here, right?

Sure! I think...

Let's check it out!

Fire!

C'mon, he needs our help!

Majesty!

Well, that takes care of that!

Hey!

Fascinating... This appears to be a portal to the past!

Yeah, it was the strangest thing!

Stop gawking! And start thinking of a way we can use it to our advantage!

Okay.

Now, perhaps I could give you one more chance to redeem yourself.

Oh, thank you, thank you! You can count on me...! So, what do I do?

Patience, my dear...

What have we here? Well, if it isn't the Cornerstone of Light... Mmm... Now we can take the castle from those fools---but we'll have to proceed with the utmost of care...

Maleficent!

She must have known all along!

Let's see...if that door's connected to the past...

No, no, no! It comes here.

Huh?

Then that means we're in the past!

Wow. If we're in the past...

...we can change the future!

Hold on, fellas! Remember what Merlin said? He's got faith in us. And we have to resist temptation no matter what!

Aw, I was only joking.

Who'd want to change the future, anyway? So...what are we gonna do?

Doors, bad guys... Gawrsh, my brain hurts!

Well, we know we're on the right track!

C'mon! He needs our help!

Whew!

Huh?

Listen well.

On the other side of this portal, they're about to begin construction on that wretched castle. But until then, their treasured Cornerstone of Light lies unguarded, with all of its power still contained!

The Cornerstone...of Light?

Yes! That cursed sphere is the very thing that prevents us from entering the castle.

Oh.

You know what must be done?

Uh...

Go then. Time to prove your worth! And don't dare to fail me again!

Don't fail her again...let's see...

That's it! I just gotta smash that Cornerstone to smithereens!

But first... I gotta go get my old boat back.

It was Pete after all!

Why, he tricked us!

Still, something doesn't seem right.

Hmm... The Pete we met here had kind of an attitude, but he didn't seem like a bad guy...

Look!

Now that castle's as good as ours!

That's the Pete we know!

Bad, bad, bad!

Oh, no!

The Cornerstone's gone!

But that means...

They're gonna fill the castle with darkness! We gotta hurry!

Hey, hold it right there!

No way, small fry! I finally found the pipsqueak what stole my steamboat!

Yeah! It was you!

Right, me!
No! No! It wasn't me! It's just somebody who looks like me!

Aw, which is it!?

Waaaait!

Shuddup!

Your future's on the line, pallie, so back off and give me the boat!

The Cornerstone!

After him!

You mugs couldn't follow me if you wanted to!

Later, losers!

I'll show you!

Oooh, I can't take anymore...

Yes!

You'll pay for this!

It's the Cornerstone!

Donald, we'll come back for it later!

Pete's headin' for the doorway!

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

Ha! You're still wet behind the ears!

Then try us!

It serves ya right!

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

The door!

Yeah...Annnd stay out!

Sora!

Yeah, I know!

Would somebody tell me what's been goin' on here? Who was that creep, anyways?

Hello? That creep was you from the future!

Sora, that's a secret!

Secret? What kinda secret? Oh, never mind. Sorry I put you guys through all that trouble.

Yeah, well, just don't make a habit out of it!

And to show ya my appreciation, I'll let you pilot my steamboat. Best little craft on the river! My deck hand Mickey's late anyways.

I betcha the castle's safe now.

Guess we should head back.

Wait! As long as we're here...

Donald!

Huh? What? No, no, no!

Hey! What's the big idea!? Let me go! Let me GO!

The thorns have disappeared!

By george! The lads have accomplished their mission.

Hooray!

Let's have an acorn feast to celebrate!

Welcome back! Because of your bravery, the castle is safe and protected again. Thank you so much for all you've done!

Good work, you guys!

Now boys, I hope you didn't do anything reckless while you were there?

Of course not!

Daisy!

Daisy, I'm back!

Who?

Daisy is Donald's very special sweetheart.

Really...

Donald, you forgot about our date again! You'd better have a good excuse this time!

But Daisy...I...

I know it's an important mission, but you could at least check in every once in a while.

Sora!

Donald!

Just be a minute...

Going somewhere?

Of course not!

Donald!

Oh, look!

Daisy, we need Donald for just a little longer.

How much longer?

Um, well...

I'll be back soon, Daisy!

Don't you worry, Queen Minnie. We'll return.

Please tell the King that we're still looking for him!

I will!

See you soon!

Think wisely!

Ah, the night sky is so beautiful right after a storm...

What would I give to live where you are... What would I pay to stay here beside you... What would I do to see you smiling at me... Where would we walk, where would we run if we could stay all day in the sun... Just you and me, and I could be part of your world...

The girl who rescued me...Her voice...

Oh boy! Under the sea again!

Uh-huh!

Whoa!

Sora! Donald! Goofy!

Uh...hi there!

You forget how to swim already?

Kinda, I guess.

Den you boys got to practice! You follow Flounder---he show you what to do.

C'mon, Sora, you can do it!

Yes, that's it! You're a quick learner, Sora!

That's much better!

Now den... What brings you three into de sea? Is somethin' going on?

But everything SEEMS peaceful.

Oh, everything's fine...as long as Daddy's in a good mood.

Hey, we got us a concert very soon. Why don't you sing in my musical extravaganza? Please say yes! Ariel's been actin' strange lately. But she might settle down and practice if you're dere, too.

You made quite a splash! That was fantastic!

Swim this way, we'll dance and we'll play now. It's very easy, come on in! Just take a chance and shake a fin!

Swim along, just join in the song. A musical for everyone to have a lot of finny fun.

Sora, you were amazing!

Hey! I wanna sing more lines!

Your Majesty! We have visitors!

King Triton!

I certainly hope there hasn't been a need to use that Keyblade of yours.

Nope. Everything's fine. Not a Heartless in sight.

Your Majesty, our guests, dey wanna sing in de musical.

Well, that sounds like a splendid idea. We may need your help after all... You see, I'm afraid Ariel's still infatuated with the human world. A busy rehearsal schedule might be just the thing she needs to stop thinking about life up on the surface.

Swim along, just join in the song. A musical for everyone to have a lot of finny fun.

That's the voice I heard! I'm sure of it!

Hello!? Where are you hiding? I know you're the girl who saved me. Please, come out so I can thank you.

Ariel?
Dat girl's acting strange again. Probably been flittin' around on da surface... Ohhh, da Sea King's gonna have my claws for dis!

C'mon, we gotta keep rehearsing!

I'm sorry, but I don't feel like it.

No! Ariel!

I've got an idea, Sebastian.

You do?

I know how to cheer Ariel up! C'mon, follow me!

Over here!

See...

Oh, no! Dis must be from de human world!

I found it after that storm--- And I bet it's from a shipwreck. Don't ya think Ariel's gonna love it?

But if de Sea King finds out about dis...

It's better than going to the surface!

C'mon, help me move it.

It's no use.

Ariel!

We'd like you to come with us, Ariel.

Have we got something to show you!

It's a pretty cool statue, huh?

It looks like some kinda prince.

A prince!?

Look at this stuff, isn't it neat? Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?

Wouldn't you think I'm the girl... The girl who has everything?

Look at this trove, treasures untold. How many wonders can one cavern hold? Looking around here you'd think...




I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty. I've got whozits and whatzits galore.

You want thingamabobs? I got twenty.

But who cares? No big deal.

I want more.

I wanna be where the people are. I wanna see... wanna see 'em dancing.

Walking around on those...

What do you call 'em?

Oh,


Up where they walk, up where they run...

Up where they stay all day in the sun...

Wandering free, wish I could be... Part of that world.

Ariel... We're here to help you, you know.

Oh, no---you three stay out of it!

Look who's talking!

Yeah! You were gonna tell her dad about it!

What am I going to do?

You're late, Sebastian. Is something wrong?

No. Nothing, Your Majesty.

That's good. So, tell me---how is the song for the musical coming?

It is finished, Your Majesty! And it celebrates all de wonderful things found here in de ocean. It will be my finest work.

Will it get Ariel's mind off the human world?

Er, yes...well... Probably... Possibly...

I-I mean, most definitely! Excuse me, Your Majesty, but I must rehearse...you understand.

This is terrible! We've got to do something.

She can't be in the musical like that.

I'll sing her part instead!

No way! Not a chance!

What? Why not!?

Hey, it's Sebastian.

Dis will never work...

What's up?

I've composed a perfect song for de musical, but I think it's gonna be too complicated for you.

Aw, c'mon! How hard can it be?

Uh-oh...

The seaweed is always greener in somebody else's lake.

You dream about going up there... But that is a big mistake.

Just look at the world around you, right here on the ocean floor.


Such wonderful things surround you. What more is you looking for?

Under the sea. Under the sea.

Darling, it's better down where it's wetter. Take it from me.

Up on the shore they work all day. Out in the sun they slave away...

While we devoting full time to floating... Under the sea.

Under the sea.

Under the sea!

Under the sea.

Under the sea!

Since life is sweet here, we got the beat here, naturally!

Naturally-y-y!

Even the sturgeon and the ray.

They get the urge and start to play.

We got the spirit, you got to hear it... Under the sea.

Under the sea.

Under the sea.

Under the sea.

Under the sea.

When the sardine begin the beguine, it's music to me.

What do they got? A lot of sand.

We got a hot crustacean band.

Eat little clam here, know how to jam here...

Under the sea.

Each little slug here, cutting a rug here, under the sea.

Each little snail here, know how to wail here.

That's why it's hotter...

Under the water.

Ya we in luck here, down in the muck here.

Under the sea.

So what do you think, Ariel?

Oh, I think it's a great song, Sebastian. It's just... it's not what I wanna sing.

I wanna sing about...how our two worlds can live in harmony---land and sea together!

De Sea King would make chowder outta me if you sang a song like dat!

If you won't listen, then I'm not going to sing at all.

A-Ariel!

Hmph! How do I get myself into dese situations? Ohh, man. Not only has dat girl fallen in love at da worst possible time, but wid a human!

Ariel's in love with a human!?

Ohh, me and my big mouth...

Oh!

Is that him?

Uh-huh.

Let's say something!

No, don't! He's a human and I'm a mermaid. I...I don't know what he'd think.

What's that?

Oh! It must be his!

But we can't reach it...

Rats!

This is great, Sora. I know he'll be happy to have this back.

And just who is this
?

Daddy!

Ariel, you know how dangerous humans are!

You don't even know him! Oh, Daddy, you've told me that you don't trust humans. But they can't ALL be as bad as you say. And I'm---well, I'm going to prove it to you.

So help me Ariel, I am going to get through to you.

And if this is the only way...

So be it.

Ariel, you poor child!

You're Ursula---the sea witch! Didn't my father banish you?

That's right, angelfish. But how could I stay away, when I knew you were so miserable? What you need is a woman's advice.

What if I could make all your dreams come true?

My father would never allow it...

Oh, well. It mustn't be love, if you give up that easily.

Could...could you really help me? But how?

Well...the only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself.

A human? Can you do that?

My dear, sweet child...that's what I do.

Dis is terrible! Flounder! You gotta go tell de King!

Okay!

Have we got a deal? I'll turn you into a human right now. All you have to do is sign a little contract.

A contract?

That's right, sweetcakes. And the price is just a token. A trifle. What I want from you is...your voice.

M-my voice?

I almost forgot---the magic only lasts for three days. You've got to get dear old Princie to kiss you before the sun sets on the third day. If he doesn't, you turn back into a mermaid, and belong to me! I suppose you might find my terms a little tough. After all, you ARE King Triton's daughter. Adored by all of a Atlantica! Why, you're practically guaranteed a happy life. Are you sure you won't listen to your daddy? All it'll cost you is your true love. Come on, sweetie pie. This is your last chance. But far be it from little old me to twist your arm.

Don't listen to her, Ariel!

Well, now. I won't intrude any longer. I'll be on my way. You obviously don't want my help. Too bad about your prince, though. He IS quite a catch...

Wait!

All I have to do is sign?

We have a deal! Here you go!

Ariel! Don't!

Sora, please! You got to stop her, mon!

Wait!

Oh, no! She can't breathe like that!

Are you the girl? Please wake up!

Whoa, easy there!

What's wrong? You can't speak? Oh... Well, where did you come from?

That's my pendant!

I-I can't believe you found it.

Thank you.

Please. Come with me. I want to help you.

Looks like it's going pretty well!

Gawrsh, shouldn't we tell King Triton about this?

Absolutely not! It would break his heart if he found out about dis!

Then what do we do?

We gonna stay right here and take care of Ariel. Dat's what we gonna do.

I guess that's all we CAN do.

So we just float here and watch?

Have you got a better idea?

We could make Ursula fix all of this.

Hah! She ain't gonna bother wid you.

Hey, you never know until you try!

Hmm... You may be right. It's gotta be better dan doing nothin'. Can I trust you to take care of Ursula?

Of course!

Hey! Where's Sebastian?

Uhh...oh...well... King Triton wanted him at the palace.

I wonder if it's about Ariel.

If King Triton finds out what happened, we're in hot water. Especially since we kept it a secret.

What about Ursula?

She disappeared.

Well, how's Ariel doing? She's only got until sunset tomorrow, right?

Hey, look!

I can't see!

They're okay!

Man... they were so close.

Well, I think we oughta get back to lookin' for Ursula.

Yeah, good idea.

No sign of Ursula anywhere...

I wonder where that sea witch coulda gone.

Ariel's been crying for a long time.

What would I give to live where you are? What would I pay to stay here beside you? What would I do to see you smiling at me?

Where would we walk? Where would we run? If we could stay all day in the sun...

Hey, what's up with the Prince?

Just you and me, and I could be...

Look! There!

Part of your world.

It's Ursula! She...she must've turned herself into that girl!

Okay, that's it!

What...what happened?

Eric!

You...you can talk... You're the one... The girl who sang to me.

Oh, Eric, I wanted to tell you.

Of course! It was you! You're the one who...who saved me that night in the storm! Oh, Ariel. I'm sorry I didn't figure it out sooner. You're the one I love.

Eric...

Not so fast!

Do you see what I see?

You're too late!

Ariel!

Stop!

Stay out of this, you fools!

Triton's precious little daughter signed a contract! Now, dearie...let's see how beautiful you are when I'm through with you!

That contract's no good!

Let her go!

Excuse me!?

Now, now---even the great King Triton can't go around breaking binding contracts. Why, it just wouldn't do, would it? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some loose ends to tie up.

Wait, Ursula... You win. Just promise you'll let my daughter go.

But we had a deal---unless, of course, you're offering to take her place?

I'm afraid...I have no choice.

Your Majesty!

At last!

Daddy!

Who's the
of the seas now?

You---you monster! Let him go!

Eric!

How dare you! Pitiful, insignificant human!

Hey! That's enough!

Ha ha! Now you all bow to me!

This witch is back to bring her wrath upon the sea. Triton can't be rid of me, not that easily.

And like all who dare defy me, he will learn his lesson well Never toy with a girl like me.

You got what you deserved!

Flotsam and Jetsam!

Loyal darlings, strong as the tide. Sweetest poopsies, hasten to my side.

Right now! Mommy needs you.

Crush those stupid fools, make them writhe!

All right!

What a feeble human. No, I can't believe my eyes.

Such a stubborn royal who is fighting for his prize.

Without your precious mermaid, now you're crazy with revenge. I suppose I sympathize.

I'm not gonna lose her!

Right! We're with you all the way!

Flotsam and Jetsam! Loyal darlings, strong as the tide.

Sweetest poopsies, hasten to my side.

Right now! Mommy needs you. Smash those stupid fools, make them writhe!

Sorry,
... Your poopsies are toast!

This is not the end, my dears, I swear I've just begun. It's not over until Ursula has won!

That's what you think!

No...it's not possible!

It's over, Ursula!

That belongs to me!

All right, then---you can have it!

Please, Ariel... You can come out now---it's okay.

Ariel?

You see, Eric...this is why I went to Ursula.

This can't be...

I would have told you sooner...

To think...

Eric...goodbye.

I had all that time and I didn't work on my swimming.

Well, I guess it's never too late to learn, right? Will ya teach me?

I'd love to!

All right!

Prince Eric's a great guy---and he's really brave, too.

Yes. But he IS a human.

Oh brother. Not again...

How'd it go with your father, Ariel?

Great! Thanks for your help. I gotta go. I'll see you later!

Hey, wait...

I almost forgot, Sebastian! King Triton said this year's festival is so important that the music better be your best ever!

My best ever? Hmm...

All right, what's going on?

You gotta do me a favor.

What?

Huh?

But how?

And it was gonna make de perfect song, too...

Looks like you can handle dis now! Now our musical will be perfect! This is it. Are you ready to start?

I'm ready! Let's do it!

Welcome the dawning of a happy age of new beginnings.

Land and see have come together, joined in peace and harmony. Fairy tales and miracles are what we're singing of.

Our dear princess, Ariel, truly fell in love. With a prince, a human prince, who lived so far above.

Wishes really can come true, if you want them to.

And this happiness inside, I owe to ev'ry one of you.

How about you introduce us to these lovely friend of yours?

Come take a bow Donald, Goofy, and Sora.

Congratulations, dear princess, to you...

You found your first love and he found you, too.

We were glad to help you out, and very proud, it's true.

Seeing how we made you grin just makes us want to twirl a fin.

Wishes really can come true, if you want them to. And this happiness inside, I owe to ev'ry one of you.

Be so kind to introduce the King, and these his loyal friends.

Please say hello Daddy, Sebastian, Flounder.

Ariel, I'm so happy for you.

Yes, happy endings are so rare and so few.

We were glad to help, and very proud, it's true.

Seeing how we made you grin just makes us want to twirl a fin.

Any other friends of yours that might be waiting in the wings?

Come say hello All my friends from ev'ry corner of the world.

A new day is dawning on a happy age of new beginnings.

Land and see have come together, joined in peace and harmony.

Fairy tales and miracles are what we're singing of.

Our dear princess, Ariel, Prince Eric from above. A happy end forever after, full of joy and love.

Sora, what's happening?

A new pathway has opened.

What? You gonna go? Dis is goodbye?

I won't do it! We'll never say goodbye!

That's right! A-one, two, three, four

Even though we're hittin' the road, our worlds are all connected.

Which means...

We are free to come and go.

And sing!

So don't be sad, and always know, we'll come back soon to say hello!

Wow!

This place is...

Kinda different.

Something's up!

Organization XIII?

Or the Heartless!

Only one way to find out.

Aztec treasure, eh?

Aye! And thanks to the curse put on it, we are neither among the livin' nor the dead.

Really? 'Cause ya look like regular pirates to me.

Ah, but in the moonlight...

Whoa! Now I get what you were sayin'... Well, if you see two doofuses and a brat holdin' a Keyblade, steer clear. They got a kinda magic that don't belong in this world, see? And nobody knows what it'd do to ya. 'Specially when the moon's showing whatcha really are.

A match for Barbossa, you say?

Hey!

See there? I knew it! Those are the punks I was tellin' ya about.

Who are you calling punks? It's Sora, Donald, and Goofy to you! And don't you forget it!

That we won't. And we'll engrave it on your tombstone, to be sure.

Whoa! I like your style.

Men---half of you stay here and indulge these cullies. The rest---bring me that medallion!

Aye!

Aw, we only get to stomp on a few of you?

It's no use! We can't beat them!

Aye, whaddya expect?

You'd best be sayin' your prayers!

Hey, watch out! They can see ya! Stay away from their magic!

What for?

Weren't you listenin' to me before?

Hey, Pete, thanks for the tip!

Hey! This ain't over!

If Pete's here, that must mean we have work to do.

Yep. And that pirate captain looked pretty mean, too.

Man, I'd hate to see him turn into a Heartless.

Well, we ARE here...

Hey, maybe we can take a pirate ship out for a spin!

Just kidding! Weren't those guys headed into town?

Yeah. I think they were looking for treasure.

Where are you taking me!? Let me go!

Elizabeth!

Stop!

What are they?

It's the Heartless! Watch out!

We'll deal with them! Go! Take cover!

Well done! My own fencing skills are not to be ashamed of...but I've never faced foes such as that before.

You really think we're that good?

Did you find your friend?

I was too late. But I must rescue her! Would you help me?

Of course! I'm Sora. This is Donald and Goofy.

And I'm William Turner, but call me Will.

Okay, Will. Let's go!

Right. We've got to get to the docks!

We're too late!

Huh?

Those pirates kidnapped Miss Swann and took her to their ship. Now they've sailed, and I'll never be able to find her!

Then she's long gone. The Black Pearl is nigh uncatchable. Best find yourself another girl, mate.

You... What are you doing aboard the Interceptor? She's off limits to civilians.

Ah, fortunate that I'm going to commandeer her, then. She'll make a fine pirate ship.

A pirate!

Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please.

Take me with you. Help me hunt down the Black Pearl and save Miss Swann. I got you out of that jail cell, Sparrow. Do this and your debt's repaid.

You'll have to win fair lady's heart alone, mate. I see no profit in it for me.

C'mon, Captain!

Are you sure you can sail her, all on your own?

You've a point there.

Thanks, Sparrow.

CAPTAIN Sparrow.

I'm Sora. This is Donald and Goofy.

I'm Will Turner.

That would be short for William, I imagine. No doubt named for your father, eh?

Yes.

Well, then, Mr. Turner. You get us ready to make way. I've some effects to liberate.

Aye-aye! But hurry.

Naturally.

Sora!

You really wanna be a pirate?

Of course not!

What do you make of this Will?

I don't know. We just met him.

Hmm... I think my luck's about to change.

You can release me. You have your trinket; I'm of no further value to you.

This is no trinket, missy. This is cursed Aztec gold. One of eight hundred and eighty-two identical pieces they delivered in a stone chest to Cortez himself.

I hardly believe in ghost stories anymore, Captain Barbossa.

That's exactly what I thought. Buried on an Island of Dead what cannot be found 'cept for those who know where it is. Find it, we did. There be the chest. Inside be the gold. And we took 'em all! We spent 'em and traded 'em and frittered 'em away on drink and food and pleasurable company.

The more we gave 'em away, the more we came to realize... the drink would not satisfy, and food turned to ash in our mouths. We are cursed men, Miss Turner. Compelled by greed, we were, but now... we are consumed by it.

How very sad for you.

There is one way we can end our curse. All the scattered pieces of the Aztec gold must be gathered and restored to the stone chest. And the blood of every soul who touched a piece o' the treasure must be repaid.

Miss Turner! For ten years we've searched every league of these waters, every town and village---preying on sailors and settlers alike! Eight hundred and eighty-one pieces we found, but despaired of ever finding the last. All those years, you been safe in your bed, readin' your pirate stories, dreamin' of adventure on the high seas---we've endured torments worse than death itself!

But now, thanks to ye, we have the final piece---at last. When this medallion is restored to the chest, we'll be free to roam the seas as men. No longer will we be ghosts!

And the blood that's to be repaid?

That's why there's no sense to be killin' ye...yet.

Ye see, the moonlight shows us for what we really are.

We are not among the livin', and so we cannot die. But neither are we dead. I've suffered too long! You'd best start believin' in ghost stories, Miss Turner. For, you see, tonight---you're in one!

Why are you so fixated on that compass?

It'll be she that leads us to the Isla de Muerta---where Barbossa's headed. Savvy?

How do you know?

Ah, lad... He and I once had our eyes on a treasure---Aztec gold. 'Twas hidden on the Isla de Muerta. But he turned traitor and stole my ship.

So he's after that treasure, then.

Treasure's already his. So's the curse upon it. I've no desire for such treacherous spoils. But I will have back what's mine---the Black Pearl.

You lads wait here. Young Turner and I will rescue the lady.

Hey! What about us?

You're to guard the ship, o' course. It's a task given only to the bravest of pirates.

All right...

Guard her well!

Shall we?

I think he was just trying to fast-talk us...

And you fell for it.

What's keeping those two?

They sure are taking their time...

If Pete's hanging around, there must be Heartless here, too. And Jack and Will aren't used to fighting Heartless... Let's go see.

Every last piece that went astray we have returned, save for this! And now, the blood will be repaid to free us from this curse forever!

Quick, they're after us!

We'll hold them off! Give us a sign when the ship's ready to sail!

Right! We'll light the signal flare!

The signal!

Where's Jack?

Well...

And now, the blood will be repaid to free us from this curse forever!

No! Not yet. We wait for the opportune moment.

When it's of greatest profit to you?

May I ask you something?

Have I ever given you reason not to trust me? Stay here...and try not to do anything stupid.

Begun by blood...by blood undone.

You! Maid! Your father. Was your father William Turner!?

No.

I don't understand!

What's going on?

Who brought this wench to us?

She said her name was Turner!

Come on!

Why isn't it working?

Get on with it!

Hurry!

You there! The medallion! After them, you ingrates!

I had to. Jack's no fairy-tale pirate. The real ones aren't to be trusted.

Is it true? You gave Barbossa my name instead of yours. Why choose my name?

I don't know.

Elizabeth...where did you get that?

It's yours. From that day we found you---drifting at sea.

After all this time... I thought I'd lost it. It was a gift from my father...he sent it to me.

I'm sorry.

Why did you take it?

Because I was afraid that you were a pirate. That would have been awful.

Of course... Don't you see? It wasn't your blood they needed... it was my father's blood--- My blood. The blood...of a pirate.

How the blazes did you get off that island, Jack?

When you sailed away in my ship and marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land, with naught but a pistol and a single shot, you forgot one very important thing, mate. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

I won't be makin' that mistake again.

Then what say you to puttin' the past behind us, untying these ropes, and letting me negotiate the return of your medallion, eh? What say you to that?

Seein' as how the Black Pearl's mine now, Jack, lettin' you go doesn't seem to fall within my interest.

Odd, I'm not actually concerned with YOUR INTEREST. Give me back the Pearl!

All right! Lock him in the brig!

We're comin' up on the Interceptor.

What do we do, Captain?

Whaddya think, you idiot?

Will, look!

What now?

I wonder what Jack would do?

I'm not sure. I suppose...he'd run for it.

Sounds good to me.

Will!

Everyone hit the deck!

We're just gonna have to fight!

Hooray!

We beat the pirates!

Well, did you now, laddie?

Jack!

Now then, I'll be having back that medallion. Unless it's more important than their lives?

Barbossa!

She goes free!

Go ahead boy---shoot! We can't die.

You can't... But I can!

My name is Will Turner! My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner! His blood runs in my veins!

On my word, do as I say, or I'll pull this trigger and be lost to Davy Jones' Locker.

Name your terms...Mr. Turner.

Release Elizabeth...and Sora, and Donald, and Goofy, too!

Anythin' else?

Leave now!

Agreed. Leave we shall...but the Heartless stay!

No fair!

Good work, Barbossa! Who knew it'd be this easy?

Barbossa, you coward!

That's the last time I trust a pirate!

The powder kegs are ready, Captain!

Then I bid ye farewell!

What are we gonna do!?

We'll be blown to smithereens!

Why struggle, mate? A pirate knows when to surrender.

Are you serious, Jack?

Your average pirate, anyway.

First, we've got to see to the gunpowder. I'm not about to lose this ship!

I still don't plan to trust pirates again.

Wise policy, lad.

All clear!

That's the second time I've had to watch that man sail away with my ship. But I'll be havin' her back soon enough.

You stay with the ship, lass!

I'll do no such thing! Will could die in there.

Dear William is fine. Trust me.

I am not a fool, Jack.

Then trust me instead!

Sora, Donald, Goofy---bring Will back safely!

Now, let's be tryin' this again! The last of the Aztec treasure has been returned.

And now, the blood will be repaid to free us from this curse forever! This time for sure!

Ahoy! Treasure, mateys!

Not possible.

Not probable! We're alive and we're pirates!

Captain Jack Sparrow!

Sora!

Donald Duck!

Goofy, too.

So you want to play pirate? Best save the playacting for the nursery. After them!

No more playacting now!

Thank you, Sora!

Uh, where's Jack?

Jack! Get him!

Huh?

Jack!

You're a fool, Jack Sparrow.

Jack...

Show yourself, Pete! The tide has changed.

See? I told ya you'd be needin' ol' Pete!

This ain't over!

Right! Care to surrender, Barbossa?

Well, enough of this, then...

What say you we call it---a draw?

Jack, how many times do I have to tell ya---

Laugh while you can, Barbossa!

I feel...cold.

What now, Jack?

Whatever I want, now that the Pearl is mine again.

That she is. Thank you, Jack.

I didn't want ye hittin' me again, mate.

Hey, Jack---good luck.

And remember to be good!

I'm off.

Will!

Good for them.

Uh-huh! Hey, Sora---how come your face is all red?

What? It is not red!

Aw, I know who you're thinking about.

You know...for a minute there...I was afraid we were gonna lose Donald to the curse of the treasure!

Yup. Me, too.

What!?

Agrabah! We made it!

Gawrsh, I wonder how Aladdin 'n' Jasmine are doin'?

Hey, maybe Riku's with them!

Yeah, and the King!

Keep dreaming, you two.

C'mon, Donald, you were thinking the same thing.

No, I wasn't!

Uh-oh, it's uh...um... It's Iago!

Wait! You got me all wrong.

You're Iago all right!

No! I mean, it's not the old me. I turned over a new feather. I'm legit! No more scams. Promise!

Bet that's your new scam.

Ya gotta believe me!

Sora, let's go!

I was stuck inside that lamp with Jafar. Remember? Well, I finally escaped. But then some things happened and...

So. Free as a bird, huh?

Have fun!

Gawrsh, fellas. He looks pretty sad.

I wanna apologize to Aladdin and Jasmine.

Could you guys maybe put in a good word for me?

Sure, we can do that, can't we?

Watch out!

Where are they all coming from?

This way!

Aw, we'd've been goners if Iago hadn't helped us. Ain't that right, fellas?

I guess we owe you one.

Perfect!

But you'll have to win over Aladdin and Jasmine yourself. Be on your best behavior, got it?

Yeah, I got it.

Where IS Aladdin, anyway?

I betcha he's at the palace.

Then let's go!

Jasmine!

Sora! Donald! Goofy!

Your Majesty.

I never had the chance to thank you for before. You helped Aladdin defeat that awful Jafar and saved Agrabah.

All in a day's work. But uh... it looks like the Heartless are up to no good again.

Is there any way we can help you out?

I think we're all right for now.

And ya always got Aladdin.

He...hasn't been himself lately.

Is it because of the Heartless?

I'm not sure. Usually, he's the same cheerful Aladdin. But sometimes...he just seems sad. He leaves the palace and goes off by himself all the time. I've asked him about it, but he says nothing's wrong. He's gone again today. What if he doesn't come back this time?

Hey, maybe he's got a secret girlfriend. I know! I'll go find out who she is!

Iago! Quick, Sora, catch him!

And I'll warn the guards and everyone in the palace!

That's the thing, Iago's not...

Nice move.

Maybe it's something you said. Gee, maybe we should go talk to Aladdin. He's gotta be somewhere in town, right?

Good idea. I wonder what he's been doing.

Stop, thief!

Hi, Sora!

Come back here!

If you can't control that fur ball...put a leash on him!

Look, I'm sorry... You should be ashamed of yourself, Abu!

No hard feelings?

Abu!

Hey guys, sorry about earlier. I was kinda in a hurry.

What happened?

You know Abu. He couldn't keep his paws off that lamp.

No talking your way out of this one!

I guess you can't be THAT down in the dumps, huh?

Who said I was?

Princess Jasmine. She's worried 'cause you're always in town.

Got a new girlfriend?

No way! Still... I guess there's no foolin' Jasmine, huh? See, Genie and Carpet took off to see the world. It's what Genie always wanted, so I wished him the best and all, but...

You miss him.

Man, things must be REALLY quiet with Genie gone.

Yeah. That's why I come here. The action---the people. There's always something goin' on. I mean, c'mon! I met you guys here today, right? This place is full of surprises.

Uh, Sora?

Iago!? Oh, right... He wants to apologize for all the trouble he caused.

Oh, he does?

Gawrsh, he's so sorry, he's shakin'!

Th-th-that lamp!

What about it?

It was THE lamp!

C'mon. There're a million like it.

Hey! I was locked up in that thing FOR MONTHS! There's no way I'd mistake it!

Then we'd better go back and talk to that peddler.

Right behind you.

Is there any way we can buy that lamp from you?

Of course. That is...IF you can afford it.

No worries!

Yeah, we can pay you in royal treasu---

Donald!

Might I be able to interest you in another fine lamp?

No, that's the one we need.

Ah, well---perhaps I can be persuaded...IF you bring me a treasure beyond even my imagination. Something, say, fit for a sultan...

Treasure? That could be tricky...

There's lots at the palace.

But it's not mine to take. And I can't ask. I don't want to worry Jasmine or the Sultan.

Hey, I know... What about the treasure in the Cave of Wonders?

All right, Iago. You lead the way! And after we get the treasure, I might even believe your apology.

You can count on me!

This is it!







There. That one should do it.

Oh boy. It's perfect. That guy's gonna like this.

Sure looks valuable.

Great! Now let's go get that lamp.

We gotta keep Jafar bottled up, or he's gonna destroy Agrabah!

Stop!

Hey, snap out of it, Donald!

Why does this always happen?

Let's go!

Hello!

Stop your whining and hand it over!

Ohh no! I'm trading it for treasure. This lamp is going to bring me riches!

Oh no, you don't! Get back here, you!

Thank you.

It's mine!

Lamp hog!

Go away!

Gotcha!

No fair!

Heh heh, I win!

Nice one, Iago!

Way to go!

Don't drop it!

Look! Behind you!

Nice try, bird brain. Just wait till Jafar's free! He's gonna make one beauty of a Heartless!

I'm HOME!

Al! It's been eons!

Al, you princely little muffin, you!

Cosmic travel can get so lonely without a friend.

To think I left you forlorn and Genie-less... Oh, the HUMANITY!

Genie?

Hey, Al, you've been puttin' on weight?

Aw, of course, what am I saying? You're living at the palace now.

Aladdin!

Jasmine!

I can just picture it...

Wait, tell me. Am I being a pest? Just a big blue pest? Aw, who cares, Al! I'm just so glad to SEE you!

Genie!

Oops!

I'll teach you to make a fool out of me!

Time for Plan B! I'm finishin' you mugs off right now!

You! You've messed with me for the last time! I'm gonna get you yet!

Yeah! All right!

I promise---you won't regret givin' me another chance. Honest!

Uhhhh... Princess Jasmine, you sure that you want that pigeon in the coop?

Oh, I think Iago's shown that he means well.

Aw, sure. You're probably right.

And how much trouble can one noisy bird cause?

You might just have a point there, kid.

What happens next, Sora?

Well, it was great seeing you all...but we still need to find Riku and the King. I guess we'll be moving on.

I hope you find 'em.

Me, too.

Hey, where's Aladdin?

He ran off toward town, looking for Abu. But he should be back by now.

Al can't miss Sora's big farewell party! I'll have him back in a jiffy!

Abu!

Catch him!

He must've secretly stolen it from the Cave of Wonders.

Abu!

Wow!

I guess some things are just hard to resist.

Aw, who needs it!

Oh... I guess it got stuck!

What!?

Whoa!

Sora... What is it?

I think it's time for us to go.

Will you be back?

We will, I promise!

Maybe...waiting isn't good enough.

My thoughts exactly! If you have a dream, don't wait. Act. One of life's little rules. Got it memorized?

Who are you?

Axel. I happen to be an acquaintance of Sora's. Why don't we go see him?

...Sora?

We've got something in common, Kairi. You and I both miss someone we care about. Hey, I feel like we're friends already.

You're not acting very friendly!

Hey, what is this place?

You okay?

What...?

You and that dog came flying out of a hole in the wall. You nearly gave us heart attacks!

Hey, this is Halloween Town, right?

Well, it sure does look like Hallowee...Wha?

Hey, it's Zero! How've you been, boy?

What's that for?

It's Jack!

Sora, Donald, and Goofy! Welcome back, and Merry Christmas!

Merry Christmas? Don't you mean,
?

Of course. Halloween greetings from Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King.

Forgive me. I'm in a Christmas mood. You see, I'm running the show again this year---but I need Sandy Claws's blessing, so I'm off to Christmas Town.


?

I think he means Santa Claus.

Aren't these decorations wonderful? This year Halloween Town's going to handle Christmas too! But first! We have to visit Sally. She's working on something no self-respecting Santa Claus can do without. Come along---I'll show you!

A Halloween Town Christmas...

Wanna go check it out?

C'mon, hurry!

Hello, Doctor! Where's Sally?

Can't you see...that I'm in the middle of an experiment?

Hey, this is way too heavy!

Then let's toss it!

You do and you'll be sorry! Now bring it over here.

Heave-ho!

Imbeciles! Now my experiment is ruined!

Sally! Did you finish it? I want to show my good friends.

I'm sorry, Jack. I...I need a little bit more time.

Ohh... Well, that's all right. Just as long as it's ready for Christmas!

But... Jack...

I'd best be off. I've got to go get Sandy Claws, right away! Wonderful to see you again. Good-bye for now!

Go get Santa Claus...?

Please, Sora. I'm afraid something terrible will happen if Jack goes through with this.

You can say that again!

Sora?

Are those strange-looking fellows in the town square with you?

Huh? What
?

You know, the ones who wanted to spoil Halloween AND Christmas? What are they called again... Heartless?

They're definitely not with us. But Donald, Goofy, and I can get rid of them for you. And then we can go see Santa!

But first, the Heartless!

Now hear this, you...you things! Leave Halloween Town at once...by order of the mayor! Jack? Where are you? I'm only an elected official---I can't handle this by myself.

Jack!

We're on it!

How is Sandy Claws supposed to relax with all this going on? That's it, fellows! Sandy Claws needs bodyguards. Are you up to the task?

Us?

Yeah.

What should we bring along next time?

A bucketful of caterpillars!

Or something even worse!

Who's that?

Some old hag!

Silence!

A witch?

Hmm...perhaps you three could be of use to me. Come along, all of you. I'll show you the true meaning of


All right, bodyguards! Christmas Town is this way! The doorway is in the woods just past the graveyard!

Here it is! The door to Christmas Town. The spooks of Halloween can get so tiresome year after year. I wanted something new. And I found this! Beyond this door is a world filled with wonders...the likes of which you've never seen! As first I couldn't believe my eyes! Everything was so fresh and exciting!

C'mon! Just open it!

Cooool!

Wow!

So where's Santa?

In his workshop. Shall we?

Here too!?

En garde, loyal bodyguards!

Christmas is in big trouble!

Gawrsh, we can't let anything bad happen to Christmas.

That's where Sandy Claws lives.

Whoa!

Well, hello everyone. Did you come to see if you're on my
list?

Your name?

Um, Sora, sir.

Let's see...Sora...Here you are. Well, according to my list, Sora...seven years ago you told everyone you did not believe in Santa Claus... Oh, that is unfortunate.

How about Donald and Goofy?

Oh, boy!

Am I on your list, too, by any chance? It's me, Jack!

Jack Skellington!?

What sort of trouble did you bring this time?

This time?

It's a long story!

Why do we have to hide?

Silence! Well, this is a pleasant surprise. That fool Jack brought Sora and the others with him. Now we can deal with all of them at once!

What do you want us to do?

Who's there?

Busted!

It's Lock, Shock, and Barrel!

Not those three...

I assure you, they're not with us.

Well, whatever the case, they've been quite naughty. Catch them and bring them back here. They're going to get a lecture.

Uh...Mr. Claws? I wanted to talk to you about Christmas first.

It'll have to wait. I need to see how things are progressing in my workshop.

C'mon, Jack---let's catch those little pranksters.

Oh, all right, then.

I was so looking forward to destroying that ridiculous Christmas Town. But now that Sora and those imbeciles are here I think a change of plan is called for. Revenge before pleasure, after all.

What kind of revenge?

The magnificent, malevolent kind, of course.

That sounds really bad.

Like Oogie's kinda bad!

And that's super-duper bad!

Oogie Boogie? That bag of incensed insects? How intriguing. And where might I find him?

Jack and his dumb, stupid friend destroyed him.

Ah yes, now I remember. More intriguing still! I believe I'll bring your master back for you.

I feel like a million bugs! I really owe you one for this, Maleficent.

Indeed you do, Oogie. Do you remember Sora, Donald, and Goofy?

Do I remember them? Ha! You're too much! I'll never forget what they did to me... Uh...What was it they did to me?

Squashed you like a bug!

That sounds bad!

And Jack helped!

Even worse!

They creamed ya!

That's right, that's right! That's one thing I won't be forgetting any time soon! It's the last thing I remember. And it's the only thing I remember until I teach those clowns not to mess with Mr. Oogie Boogie!

Yes...that's right. That's the spirit. And I have the perfect plan already in mind.

Have you ever heard of Christmas Town?

Mr. Oogie!

Wake up! Wake up!

We want to see how bad you are!

It seems he needs more time to recover. You three---stay here and keep Sora and the others occupied.

My Heartless will help you. But do not fail me!

There they are!

Stop them!

Tie 'em down!

Get 'em!

Ah ha ha ha!

That was fun!

Let's go see if Mr. Oogie's ready!

Oogie!?

Isn't he the one who tried to take over Halloween Town before?

That's him. Fellows, I hope you're ready for trouble...

Don't we have enough trouble already?

Confound it. Now I've lost my way.

Oh, this is utter foolishness. I should be getting ready for Christmas.

Is that you... Mr. Sandy Claws?

Yes, but...please, call me Santa Claus.

Of course. Mr. Santa Claus, I was hoping I'd find you here. You see... It's very important that you go back to Christmas Town. I'm afraid something terrible is going to happen if you don't.

Well, I am behind on my preparations... All right. Tell Jack I'll be waiting for him at home. He had something to say to me about Christmas.

But that's just it. Please, go home and lock the door. And if Jack knocks, don't open it!

There. The large one in red.

All I gotta do is kidnap him?

That's right. Lock him up at once! Then begin destroying Christmas Town. That's sure to make Sora and the other fools come running.

And then they're all mine!

Yes. And in the meantime, I'll turn Santa Claus into Santa Heartless!

Are we done?

Who's there?

What's wrong, Sally?

Jack! Oogie's kidnapped Santa Claus!

Oh, no!

And he's headed to Christmas Town!

C'mon, Jack---let's hurry!

I've done a little redecorating!

Wait... Something's not quite right. I know what it is! We just need a little more of that Oogie flair!

I do hope our jolly old friend is looking forward to becoming a Heartless.

Clumsy oaf!

Are you still here? Why don't you Oogie on back where you came from. You're crampin' my style!

Have you already forgotten who brought you back, you insolent bag of bugs?

Sorry! Can't remember a thing!

Very well, you ingrate. You'll rue the day you spurned my help!

That's Santa's house!

Jack Skellington!

Oogie!

You and I have a score to settle, Jack! Same goes for your little sidekicks!

What are you planning to do with Sandy Claws?

Who? Sandy Claws? I don't know what you're talking about!

And why is this roly-poly red guy here? Time to go, grandpa!

Eh?

Mr. Santa Claus!

Why, you...

Stop!

Huh?

Not again!

Nice view from up here!

That's right, away you go!

All right, Christmas is safe again!

Perfect! I'd better get down to business!

Leave that to Santa!

Yup, you oughta stick to Halloween and spooky stuff!

Jack?

Here, it's done.

Wonderful! Why, I love it! Thank you, Sally!

Jack... Do you really have to do this?

But I make a splendid Sandy Claws!

Listen here, Jack Skellington. You saved me, and Christmas as well. And for that, I'm very grateful. But please promise you won't cause any more trouble! And about that suit!

Don't even think about taking over for me again!

I just thought you could use a little help this year, Mr. Claws. You must be exhausted from all the preparations. And---I wouldn't mind a second chance to get this Christmas thing right.

Yes, being Santa Claus can be tiring. But let me tell you something, Jack. Seeing the happy faces of little children when they discover the presents I've brought them makes it all worthwhile, year after year after year. And you, Jack---you love to make them gasp and see them shiver with fright. What if someone tried to take all of that away from you?

We both have very important jobs to do, Jack. Mine is to take care of Christmas, and yours is to take care of Halloween. So we each have to do the very best we can. After all, you're the face of Halloween---Mr. Jack Skellington! The Pumpkin King! The Knight of Nightmares! And even though you're fascinated with Christmas, Jack...Halloween is your true specialty. Don't you see? Children rely on both of us to do our jobs. Halloween needs your attention...and I know Christmas needs mine---urgently.

You're right! I am the master of terror! And if Halloween has become too routine, all I have to do is think of something new that'll really make them scream!

Jack! Oh, Jack! I've been looking for you everywhere! We must go over the plans for next Halloween! I can't do a thing without your approval!

So true.

Good luck, Jack Skellington.

Well, there he goes.

Yes, and I've got lots of names to check and preparations to finish!

Jack, this is no time for joking!

What's this? Perhaps a bit too festive for our Halloween needs.

We better get going.

Before you do, Sora... I believe there's a friend of yours...who---if I recall correctly---was the one who told you there's no such thing as Santa Claus?

Oh yeah... He did say that.

Be sure to give him my very best wishes.

I will, but... Do you know where I can find Riku?

No...but don't give up! Remember, if you believe in Riku, you will find him. Just as you found me.

Right!

Nooooo!

Nooooo!

Hey! Check us out.

This place is kinda creepy, though.

Uh-huh.

Heartless?

I dunno, Sora. I get the feelin' they might live here.

Don't mind us! Just passing through. We won't be any trouble.

Yeah, that's right!

Don't be silly. We'd love you to stick around for lunch.

Um...we didn't bring anything to eat.

That's not gonna be a problem!

Gawrsh, Sora---I think WE'RE the lunch!

Going somewhere?

Man, that Scar's got the worst timing.

Just let him roar.

Nah, we better go see what he wants. Sounds like he's grumpy enough already.

Fine.

I dunno what that was about, but I'm glad it's over!

Everything's harder on four legs...

Better start practicing!

I found a trick to it. Here, lemme show ya.

Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

Heartless!?

What do we do?

Stay back!

Definitely Heartless.

Thank you. You really saved me.

We're just glad you're okay.

Did you see any other Heartless around here?

Heartless... Is that what they're called? I'm not sure if there are any others... I don't usually hunt outside the Pride Lands.

Pride Lands?

Hey, do you know if a guy named Riku is there? Or some bad guys in black hoods? Or maybe this really big bully named Pete?

Oh well, we might as well go take a look, anyway.

Wait---the Pride Lands are dangerous. Scar and the hyenas have made things unbearable for everyone. There's no food left. They've driven off the prey. We're about to starve.

We can handle a little danger. You just saw us beat those Heartless, didn't you?

I guess you're right... You could be just what the kingdom needs. Maybe you can help us.

Ya mean take on this Scar guy and all those hyenas?

Scar?

He took over when our last king, Mufasa, died.

So you're saying this guy is your king. You want us to take down your king?

Wait just a minute. We can't just go around knocking kings off their thrones. Then again, if they see that I'm stronger than their king, maybe they'll ask me to be their next king!

Sora...

I'd have to refuse, of course. Still, I'd like to see the Pride Lands, so you guys don't mind lending 'em a paw, do you?

Uh-oh, there he goes again...

She's gonna go on ahead and tell the other lionesses. We're supposed to meet her at a place called Pride Rock.

That's him.

Uh....what?

What is it?

I told Rafiki you might be able to help us force Scar and the hyenas out of the Pride Lands. But he says it won't work. You see, whoever saves the Pride Lands will be our next king...and he has to have the right qualities.

Meaning...

I think she means you're not cut out for the job, Sora.

I'm sorry you came all this way.

Hey, no---it's okay.

You'd better go before Scar finds out you're here. I'm really sorry.

Hey---a snack.

Snack? Nah, we got us a three course meal.

Look at that, here comes Scar---the king.

And Pete!

My back...

What are you doing here!?

Aww, the cute li'l kitty's worried about me. If I were you, I'd be more worried about my friends!

Sora!

We're surrounded!

Go on, ladies---you've got some hunting to do.

The herds have moved on, Scar. We can't hunt in a land with no prey.

No prey? Then what do you call this?

We're not prey!

Oh. Nice and fresh, too.

Well, they're all yours, Scar.

Run!

Follow me!

I'm sorry I got you involved in this.

It's no big deal.

Aw, it's not your fault. Sora wouldn't be a good king.

Hey! I had to give it a try, right?

So you DID want to be king!

Well...you know... Uh, Nala, isn't there anybody else who could be king?

There was... but he died... when he was just a cub. He was the son of our last king, Mufasa. If only Simba were here...

Simba!? But Simba's just fine! He was fighting right beside us not that long ago.

You mean Simba's alive!? But where is he?

That... I don't know.

Still... Simba's alive! I can't believe it... Please---tell me more about him.

Of course!

But first, we should get away from Scar. We'll go through Wildebeest Valley. He won't follow us there.

Hey, why the long face, Simba? You gotta lighten up and live a little!

Y-yeah...

What were you thinkin' about?

Lemme guess. The past, right?

Hakuna matata!

Would you look how he's grown, Pumbaa. Why, when I rescued the little guy, he was only this big.

Wow!

What's wrong?

We're never gonna make it.

I guess Rafiki was right.

What?

Never mind. It's not important. Here, I'll show you how. You can do it!

When Simba's father, King Mufasa, died, we were told that Simba died alongside him.

Who told you that?

Scar.

It is time.

It must be Simba! Sora! Hurry!

Wait up!

Simba!

I-it's me---Sora! Donald and Goofy are here, too.

Sora! Donald! Goofy!

What happened to you?

Help! Simba! Heeelp!

She's gonna eat us!

Timon? Pumbaa!? Something must have happened in the jungle! I have to go help my friends!

Okay, we'll back you up!

Simba! Wait!

Stop!

It's Nala! Don't you recognize her?

Nala?

It's me, Simba!

Simba!

You are alive!

Hey! What's goin' on here!?

Don't worry. They're all friends of mine.

So that means...nobody's planning to eat anybody else for lunch, right?

Are you sure they don't wanna eat me like I'm some kinda pig!?

We won't...but you are a pig, right?

Call me Mr. Pig!

Could you guys excuse us for a few minutes?

Why am I not surprised?

Simba, you've got to come back to Pride Rock. I thought Sora might be able to help, but you're the only one who can save us from Scar.

I can't go back.

Why?

Hakuna matata. It's something I learned out here. Sometimes bad things happen and there's nothing you can do about it.

Simba...

Hakuna!

Matata!

Hakuna!

Matata!

He's not the Simba I remember. Something about hakuna matata...

My father's dead. And it's because of me... It's my fault. I can't go back... It won't change anything.

Look at the stars. The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars. So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those kinds will always be there to guide you... And so will I.

Father...are you there?

Simba... you have forgotten who you are. You must take your place in the Circle of Life.

How can I go back? I'm not who I used to be.

Remember who you are.

You can all come out now.

I'm going back to face my past. I could use your help.

He really is a king...

Wait a minute. We're gonna fight your uncle for THIS?

Yes, Timon. This is my home.

Simba! You're...alive!

This kingdom doesn't belong to you.

Simba's the rightful king.

The choice is yours, Scar. Either step down or fight.

Must this all end in violence? I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member, Simba...

I've put the past behind me.

But what about your faithful subjects? Have they?

Simba, what's he talking about?

Go on. Tell them who's responsible for Mufasa's death!

I am.

He admits it! Murderer! If it weren't for you, Mufasa would still be alive. Do you deny it?

No! But it was an accident!

You're in trouble again. But this time, Daddy isn't here to save you. And now everyone knows why!

Now this looks familiar. I think I've seen this before. Oh, yes! I remember. This is just the way your father looked...before he died.

And here's my little secret... I killed Mufasa.

Murderer! Tell them the truth!

All right. All right! I did it.

Louder!

I...killed...Mufasa!

Simba! You get Scar! We'll handle these guys!

'Scuse me! Pardon me! Comin' through!

Where's Simba?

He went up there.

Simba!

This is his fight, Donald.

You're okay!

Aw, that was just a sneak preview! 'Cause this ain't over---not by a long shot!

Anger and jealousy turned the king of Pride Rock into a Heartless! Oh, your kingdom's gonna rise again...

But this time, as the Pride Lands of Darkness!

That's what you think!

I am the king!

Simba...

Hey, what's with the light show?

We have to say goodbye for a little while.

I'll go tell Simba.

Aw, he's prob'ly busy. Just tell him we'll be back soon.

Oh, that's right---he's king now. He's gonna be so busy he'll prob'ly forget all about his two best buddies.

Well, you always got hakuna matata, right?

Guess so...

Whaddaya mean,
!? What if he forgets to tell the carnivores who we are? One look at you, and you're a pig roast.

That's MISTER Pig Roast.

Same thing! And I'm not sticking around to be anybody's pork dinner!

Pumbaa!

You can never forget your true buddies.

Looky there! Twilight Town!

Yep, I can see it! It's back again!

H-Help! The sandlot! It's Seifer! Somebody please help us!

Sound like we've got trouble!

We'll take it from here!

Impressive.

By the way, have you seen a man named Axel? I expect he's here somewhere.

Like I care.

You see, Axel's no longer acting in our best interest.

Is he with the Organization, too?

Yes.

You havin' a fight?

Not a very organized Organization...

Don't let your guard down. Axel will stop at nothing to turn you into a Heartless.

Gee, thanks for looking out for us, mister. But I'm sure we can take care of ourselves just fine.

Glad to hear it. Axel aside, it would break our hearts to hear something happened to you.

Hearts? You don't have any hearts!

True, we don't have hearts.

But we remember what it was like. That's what makes us special.

Whaddya mean?

We know very well how to injure a heart. Sora, you just keep on fighting those Heartless.

Let's jump in after him!

How come?

I'm not sure, but maybe he'll lead us to the Organization's world.

Don't be reckless. Do you want to end up like Riku?

What!?

Hey, wait! ...What did he mean, end up like Riku?

Hey, how 'bout you get out of my town now? You've caused enough trouble.

Riku...

Have it your way! C'mon, guys.

Hold it!

Make up your mind!

This goes to the strongest guy in Twilight Town.

Thanks, but...we don't really need it.

Whoa!

Oh! Sora!

Um...Pence, right?

Do you know a girl named Kairi?

K...Kairi!? I sure do!

Then you better come to the station!

He-ey!

Hey, so how do you guys know Kairi?

Kairi was really here!?

Yeah. And...she said she was looking for you.

Tell me where she is!

Well...

What a romantic story!

If you stick around, Sora's bound to show up.

Yeah, he said he's coming back.

Okay!

What took you so long, Kairi?

Somehow I just knew you'd be here. I tell ya, Kairi, you've got a lot of guts, jumping right into the darkness like that.

Let go of me! Let go!

Kairi...

Ya think it mighta been Axel?

Sorry...

Hey, it's not your fault. C'mon, cheer up! Like I can even say that...

I gotta help Kairi!

Whoa!

That was close!

Sora!?

Sora! Are you okay?

Huh? What...?

Wh-what just happened?

A new road is open. And Kairi and Riku are waiting somewhere along it.

You'd better hurry, then.

You comin' back?

Promise!

I passed on the message as you so desired. I told the young Sora to keep defeating the Heartless.

Good. Not only have you the power to inflict pain, you also have the power to plant seeds of doubt in one's receptive heart.

Sora will soon begin to doubt himself. It will cause him to hesitate and that hesitation will turn to anger. That anger will fuel him to get rid of his apprehension and move forward. He will pave the way for the future we desire.

There's something I've meant to ask.

About Axel?

The poor fool. How long will he keep chasing the illusion of friendship, when he himself lacks emotion? Trying so hard to retrieve what he has lost, when it may never have existed in the first place. He deserves nothing more than our pity.

The King, Riku---and now I've lost Kairi again, too.

Don't be sad!

Donald's right, you know! Why, you're the key that connects everything!

So it's all MY fault.

Gawrsh, I didn't mean that. Just do what comes natural to ya and we're sure to find 'em.

You said it!

Thanks, guys.

Oh no! Hollow Bastion! It's all covered in darkness!

You're right, Chipper! I wonder what's goin' on.

Sora! We better hurry and check it out right away!

Do you think...

Looks like there's more Heartless now.

Uhhh....

Let's go check in with everyone.

I think they're at Merlin's.

Ach! I was so close to recreating that flavor, too...

What, lads? Leon and his friends are in the borough. Aye, Merlin's house.

Oh, Cloud!

Whatcha doing?

I'll get him. This time we settle it. Me, and the one who embodies all the darkness in me.

I thought you looked kinda different, Cloud.

If I do, it's his fault.

Whose?

Sephiroth. Tell me if you see him.

Okay. What's he look like?

Silver hair. Carries a long sword.

Sure. Well, be seeing you, Cloud.

Be careful. He messes with your head, makes you think darkness is the only way.

Is something wrong?

Uhh...

It's nothing.

I don't want you involved.

You mean you don't want me there when you go away again?

I just--- Listen, even if I go far away, I'll come back.

Do you mean it?

Yeah.

See? You don't look so sure. Well, okay, I understand. Go---get things settled.

Huh?

No matter how far away you are...once you find your light...I'm sure it will lead you back here again. Right?

I suppose.

So I'll stay here---and I'll cheer for you--- Okay, Cloud?

Okay.

Wonder if he'll be okay.

He'll be fine. I'm sure there's some light in him somewhere.

You're right.

Hey, fellas---you're just in time. Got some good news for ya, so get yourselves over to Leon's.

What kind of news?

We found the computer Ansem was using!

Oh boy!

Yep. Should be able to get all kinds of info on the Heartless and the Organization.

And maybe something on the dark realm, too? It looks like that's where Riku and Kairi are.

And the King.

Go see for yourselves!

It can't hurt!

What do you mean?

Nothin'. Just get to the computer room through the castle postern. Watch your step!

Excuse me, are you with the Restoration Committee?

What's Leon's gang up to?

They've got stuff to do over by the castle postern.

Scoop!

Huh?

Let's report.

To who?

Our leader, of course!

Yeah, you know, Malefi---

Don't mind her. I assure you, we come in peace.

You're kidding...

Problem?

Okay, fine. You do the talking.

So sorry about this!

Leon!

Over here!

You guys found Ansem's computer?

Uh-huh. The King is very interested in it.

The King?

He's with Leon.

We get to see the King!

Hooray!

Er... Is Riku with them?

Well, at least I can ask the King about him. And that computer might be able to tell us something.

Good idea! They're right through there.

Ansem...

Gawrsh, I guess this must be his room.

Where's the King?

Hello?

Hey, you!

I'm looking for somebody. Have any of you seen a guy with spiky hair?

Spikier.

I'll just take a look around.

Sorry to bother you.

No bother, ma'am!

So you made it.

Leon!

Isn't the King with you?

You'll see him soon enough.

Hey!

Here, this ought to tide you over.

Ansem's computer room.

This is it! Where's Kairi? Where's Riku?

Easy... You wanna break it?

Oh, sorry. Guess I got a little carried away.

Whoa!

Hmm?

Whoa!

Get offa there!

Attention current user. This is a warning. Further misuse of this terminal will result in immediate defensive action.

Who's there?

I am the Master Control Program. I oversee this system.

Where are you?

Donald!

I'm sorry...

Decision gate reached. You are now under arrest.

Arrest!?

Run!

Sora!

Go one, show 'em who's boss!

Who're you?

I am Commander Sark.

A Heartless commander?

Observe.

Okay, you're the boss! I get it.

Man, what kind of world is this, anyway?

You're inside a mainframe computer system.

A what system?

A computer system---for processing data. This system is a copy of one created by a corporation called ENCOM. The original program was destroyed.

But this copy was acquired by another User. The new User updated and customized the programs, renaming the system
He used the system for town maintenance, and to advance his private research. My name is Tron. I'm a security program. But now I'm under arrest, same as you.

Did you guys get any of that?

Gawrsh... You know...maybe we should just introduce ourselves.

I'm Sora.

And I'm Donald.

Nice to meet'cha, Tron. I'm Goofy.

With that configuration, you must be Users.

Users?

You'd better get out of here quickly. Who knows what the MCP will do to you?

MCP?

The Master Control Program. It controls the whole system. If you idle here, you will be de-rezzed.

De-rezzed!?

So, how do we get outta here!?

This terminal could've gotten you back to the User world. But the MCP cut the power 50 microcycles ago.

If we could bring the energy core in the canyon online, we could power it back up. The problem is---we're stuck in this cell. We're not going anywhere unless we unlock the energy fields.

Master Control. Why not just de-rezz Tron?

I still haven't located the password to the dataspace.

What about a logic probe? With all your processing power...

Out of the question. The current environment hampers the processing power needed for such an analysis.

You're dismissed, Sark. Stop any remaining anomalies in the system---or else. End of line.

Acknowledged.

Remarkable... It seems you have some unique functions. I'll go with you to the canyon. You'll need someone who can interface with the energy core, right?

If you say so... Thanks, Tron.

This is the energy core.

Mission accomplished?

Yes. Now...will you do something for me?

You got it!

Don't you want to hear what it is first?

You helped us! Now it's our turn.

You guys really are Users. Your actions are totally illogical.

Let's hurry back to the pit cell.

Where's that again?

That's the sector where we met.

Roger!

So what did you want us to do?

Find my User. He'll give you the password to access the DTD.

You bet!

So, um...

DTD is the name my User gave to the dataspace. Copies of all the original system programs are stored there, along with anything that's sensitive or restricted.

Is there stuff about the Heartless, or Organization XIII?

Hmm...Most likely.

A number of my functions were appropriated when I last took on the MCP. That's why I need the password. If I can get inside the DTD, I can access my original backup program and restore all my functions. Then, I'll be able to put this system back the way it was before the MCP got control and changed everything. The way it was supposed to be---a free system for you---the Users.

Gee, Tron, ain't the MCP one of those programs, too? Do ya know who it was who made it?

Actually...I don't know.

Okay, we'll just have to find your user and ask him. What's his name?

You mean you don't know? My user is the user of this system Ansem the Wise.

Ansem!?

Looks like the MCP's on to us. I'll keep this terminal up and running. You better exit the system, now!

Sure... But Tron...Ansem is...

We'll get ya the password!

Okay. You're good to go. Hurry!

We did it!

Where have you been?

Well, uh... There's a...world inside this computer, where these, um...programs live, and...

So in other words...Ansem's research data is off-limits unless we know the password.

I think that's right.

But you've already defeated Ansem...

Gawrsh, maybe we'll never find the password.

That means...this is all a wild goose chase.

You're chasing what, now? Well, well! A hidden room! Guess I'd better take another look around.

She just won't give up...

And neither will we!

C'mon, we've gotta look for that password!

Right. We made a promise to Tron.

Excuse me.

What's this doodle?

Hollow...Main...Security...Tron... Door to...

Looks like a diagram or somethin'.

Door...to...darkness?

Oh!

D---T---D!

DTD!

What's up?

Look at this! This must be the dataspace! The DTD. See? The Door To Darkness!

What do you know. But...that still leaves the password.

Say, fellas, did somebody mention the Door To Darkness?

Your Majesty!

Long time no see!

Shh!

The Organization might be listening!

You mentioned the Door To Darkness?

Uh, yes, sir! Ya see, we're lookin' for the secret password.

Password?

Oh, I guess you mean like a code.

Well, the Door To Darkness can only be opened by the seven princesses. There's Snow White, Jasmine, and Belle...

Of course...

What're you trying to do?

With that password, we can get access to Ansem's research data.

So that means you might be able to find out where he is!

Stop jokin' around, Your Majesty. We already defeated Ansem. You know that.

Looks like I've got a lot of explainin' to do.

We're listening, Your Majesty!

Okay...but first, I've got a question...

Hey, isn't Tron waiting for you guys?

Don't worry, I'm not goin' anywhere. If those Heartless attack, I'll stand and fight with everybody here.

Yeah...we will, too.

Then let's talk more later.

That's a promise!

I'll see ya when you get back. Oh! One more thing. Let me give your clothes some new powers, Sora.

Really!?

You bet! You've done so much---just consider it a thank-you present.

Thanks, Your Majesty! We're heading off to see Tron now, so wait here for us, okay?

I will, Sora. And remember---be careful!

Gawrsh, I wonder where Tron is.

Don't touch that!

Huh?

Goofy!

Uhh...I didn't do it!

I didn't touch nothin'!

Welcome to the game grid.

Game grid?

That's right, you've been chosen to play a few games. Lose, and you will be subject to immediate de-resolution. Win? Well,
no one wins.

We're not gonna play your games!

You have no choice.

Well then, get on with it!

All right! It looks like we can escape through there!

Tron!

I don't understand. Why are you here?

We came to give you the password.

Why didn't you just transmit the data?

Transmit?

Hey, are you okay?

I'll be all right...once we access the DTD.

All right, what's the password?

Well...Belle, Snow White...

Aurora, Alice, Jasmine, Cinderella...

Kairi.

Kairi, got it.

That did it!

Now switching DTD over from hibernation to active mode. This process will take some time. Please enjoy a game while the process is running.

Oh, no!

Not another game!

No, it's the DTD's final security routine. This isn't a game. Stay focused!

Warning! You will be de-rezzed!

I'm as good as new! All my functions have been restored!

Oh boy!

Finally. I have full access to the DTD. My takeover of the system is now complete. I might have anticipated such a simple password. What's this? An emergency destruct program for the town. Let's see how it performs.

No!

Program! You changed the password!

There, that should buy us some time.

Tron! Tell us what's going on!

The MCP's loading a hostile program into the I/O tower.

What do we do?

We've got to protect the User town.

Let's head to the tower!

It must be total chaos outside.

I think there's gonna be trouble INSIDE, too...

I'm disappointed in you, Program. Why do you insist on allying with these selfish Users?

Because I want to help them. Something written into my code commands me to do what is right.

Really? And what command would that be?

I can't really say for sure.

Friends--- They help each other, that's all.

Uh-oh---look out!

I really owe you one. With all my functions up and running, I think I've got a chance of getting system control away from the MCP. Now I'd better get to work. It's what my User would want.

What Ansem would want...

Listen, Tron. We didn't get the password from Ansem. We just sort of found it, back in the User world. By accident. And one more thing...Ansem---he was our enemy. I mean...he still is...I guess.

Well, actually...he's my enemy, too.

What do you mean?

Ansem took ENCOM's original system and customized it for his own use. I was part of the original system, and Ansem modified me, too. So that makes him my User.

But Ansem is also the one who brought back the MCP. The Ansem I first knew wouldn't do that. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

That's okay...but now I REALLY don't get it.

I don't...understand it either. But I think Users, like you, are going to be the ones who will finally figure it out. You have the ability to take illogical routes and still arrive at the answers you seek. Now go---before the MCP starts acting up again! Any data you need from the DTD can be accessed directly through my User's terminal. I'll keep a dedicated access channel open for you. I changed the password, so you won't have to worry about the MCP for a while.

Access channel?

I knew you'd ask.

It's a very important link between our worlds. It's how we stay connected.

You...my friends...are the new password.

Thanks Tron! Take care!

You too! And give my best to the Users!

Well, that's that!

Look.

Tron...hang in there.

So, where do we start?

I know! Let's access the DTD!

The King's checking the situation in town. He'll be back soon, so don't worry. Hey, look, it's asking for a password.

That's easy. It's...

Sora!

Donald!

Goofy!

That's...to the point.

Well?

That did it. We're in. I have to go into town. Need to see what that last shakeup did.

You're not gonna check out the data? It wasn't exactly easy to get!

I'm coming right back. Hey, Sora---why don't you get started on loading the data and copying it down?

It's just a few keystrokes. Easy, right?

Did it work?

Hey, these things take time, okay?

Whoa... It's doing something!

Huh?

I think it wants to know what we wanna know.

Riku and Kairi!

No way... Even Ansem's computer doesn't know...

Whatcha doing?

I thought I'd ask the computer if it can tell us about them Nobodies.

What's this?

The data is corrupt.

What!?

How about the Organization?

There!

The data is corrupt.

Stupid computer!

Sora!

Who's this guy?

Well, I see ya got things workin'!

Oh, Your Majesty!

Good goin'. The computer should tell us the things we need to know.

But it keeps on sayin' the data inside's all ker-skuffled.

All we got is a picture of some guy we don't know.

Ansem the Wise!

Come on, are you teasing us again?

Did you forget what Ansem looked like, Your Majesty?

Of course I do! And this is him! I'm positive!

Huh?

Excuse me? Could you come this way, please?

Look, THIS is Ansem. You know, the guy we all worked reeeally hard to defeat?

Oh, that's right---I never finished explaining.

What?

Well, the man in the picture is definitely the one who tried to take over Kingdom Hearts---the one you fellas defeated.

But, what you actually fought was his Heartless. Ya see, he wasn't really Ansem. He just went around telling everybody that he was.

You mean...

Ohh...

Hmm...

Whaaaat?

We went through all that trouble to defeat an impostor?

Yep. A fake. But he still had to be stopped.

Aw, I can't believe it...

Uh, I'm kinda confused. If he's a fake, then what happened to the real Ansem?

Well, that's just what I'm tryin' to figure out. Ansem the Wise should know all about Organization XIII's plans, and what's been happening to the worlds. I'm pretty sure he'll give us some help. Ya know, I came close to finding him once...

Hmm?

Don't tell me there's more...I'm lost enough as it is!

Well, let's see. Some feller named Ansem, who wasn't really Ansem, became a Heartless. Does that mean a Nobody got created when that happened, too?

Yup! And that Nobody is the leader of the Organization.

Whaaaat?

I know I've met this fake Ansem before, and I've seen the leader of Organization XIII, too. Hmm, kinda felt like bein' around the same fella.

So, where did you meet this guy?

Gosh...I can't remember. Ansem the Wise---the real Ansem---must know the imposter's true identity. That's why I've got to find him and ask him about it.

You...! You started all of this! Because of you, Riku and Kairi... Oh! Your Majesty, do you know where Riku is?

He's... I'm sorry. I can't help.

Really, Your Majesty? Are you sure?

I'm sorry, Sora.

What about Kairi? Organization XIII might've kidnapped her.

Oh, no!

Sora, Donald, Goofy. I was plannin' to go get help from Ansem the Wise. But---now I know I forgot the most important thing. Helping others should always come before asking others for help. We're safe and sound---and free to choose! So there's no reason we shouldn't choose to help our friends.

Let's look for Riku and Kairi together.

Outside!

Sounds like we gotta start by helpin' out here!

Here me, my Heartless! Attack the white husks! Sweep them away!

What, are you nuts? We're never gonna win! I don't know about you, but I'm outta here, sister!

You pathetic coward!

Heartless! Leave the white ones. Turn your attention to Sora and his friends!

Uh-oh!

Where's Maleficent?

Looks like she ran away.

Well, that was PRET-ty lame of her.

I guess we picked the wrong side.

Umm, hey...if you're looking to pick sides, why don't you pick Leon's? They can always use help.

Does this Leon have any treasure?

Yeah, lots of stuff!

Perfect!

Come on.

Who ARE you?

Oh, we're nothing worth mentioning.

Just three treasure fanatics.

Later, taters!

Did Leon...really have any treasure?

We don't have time for you!

Whoa!

Sora, it's Sephiroth!

Ain't Sephiroth the one who's supposed to be the dark part of Cloud's heart?

Did Cloud tell you that? Then he must understand now.

Just what are you gonna do to him?

Nothing. Cloud is the one who hungers for Darkness.

He said he's got a score to settle with you.

I see... He wants to meet me again.

Then I should give him what he wants. That last bit of light is always the hardest to snuff out.

Sora! Behind you!

The King's in the bailey. You better head over there!

Got it!

Whoa...

Think you can handle this many?

Well... Might be tough if one more shows up.

Then that'll have to be the one I take care of.

What, you're fighting too?

Sephiroth!

I understand that you've been looking for me.

Yeah. Once I get rid of you, the darkness will go away.

Can you do it? That darkness comes from your own dark memories. Do you think you can erase your past?

Shut up!

Face it---you turn your back on the present and live in the past. Because the light of the present is too much!

You don't know me!

Cloud!

I know. Because...I am you.

Cloud! Wait!

Leon, everybody---hang in there!

Okay, fellas, you've gotta go find Riku and Kairi!

But Leon and the others are friends too!

Don't worry. There's already lotsa help here. We'll take care of this fight.

But...I promised Leon!

Donald! Goofy!

Take Sora and get goin'!

Riku, Kairi...give me a little time, okay?

Your Majesty!

We understand. We'll go search for Riku and Kairi!

Right. Watch for danger!

You be careful, too!

Wait, you guys!

Sora, do as you're told!

You're comin' with us whether ya want to or not!

C'mon, Sora! Ya gotta be good!

Gotcha.

Well then, skedaddle!

Let's go!

I'm sorry, Your Majesty!

Hope you can forgive us!

Master Ansem. Regarding the experiment I presented the other day... With your permission, I'd like to proceed---

I forbid it! Forget this talk of doors, and the heart of all worlds. That place must not be defiled!

But, Master Ansem! I've been thinking...

Xehanort...Those thoughts are best forgotten.

It has been far too long...friend.


Zexion! Zexion!

Right here! What is it?

Where is Lord Xemnas?

His usual spot.

The
.

Yes. Go and see for yourself.

That isn't funny! I suppose I have no choice but to wait.

But the clock is ticking. Time is running out! What to do... Why is he never around when I need him? It's almost as if he knows I'm looking for him. The whole world is...

Y'know, I don't like that place either.

What about you, Zexion? What do you think?

I think eavesdropping is intrusive. Why are you even here? You and Xaldin were tasked to recruit new members.

Have you forgotten? Or were you procrastinating?

As if! I'm doing my job. I'll have you know I found one just yesterday.
something. That puts the Organization's count at 11. And since I've been working so hard, I had Lexaeus take my place for the day. I want to rest up for tomorrow, so I can wake up feeling nice and refreshed.

Is that so? Well then, I will leave you to it. I've work to catch up on. Good day.

Don't be like that. C'mon, stay and talk.

Isn't it time you told me about Xemnas's secret?

How long ago was it... When a bunch of warriors wielding key-shaped swords appeared and unleashed a spectacular battle. And when it was all over, all that was left was a man lying unconscious without his memories. Xemnas--Uh, I mean Xehanort, was found by Ansem right around then, wasn't he?

Your point?

The
. If you recall, that's where we spent our time researching the darkness that resides within people's hearts. It's a graveyard that was sealed by order of Ansem the Wise. The first thing Xemnas did once he got rid of him was to undo the seal and build a room in the back. Ever since then, he holds himself up in that room when he can, and he talks to someone.

But who? For all I know, he's the only one in that room.

Need I repeat myself about eavesdropping.

Not eavesdropping. Couldn't hear what they were saying. Dying to find out what it was though. You wouldn't know anything about it, would you?

I know I would very much like to focus on my own duties...

...as you should with yours. For we need to prepare the new facility immediately. But there are only eleven of us in the Organization. We're going to need a few more hands on deck.

What new facility? Oh, you mean Castle Oblivion. What does Xemnas plan on doing with that place anyway?

He already shared his intentions with us.

But did you know there's something he didn't share?

The
is part of a pair. The
is the other. Another graveyard, if you want to call it that. It was constructed by someone other than Xemnas himself.

And that's where he'll find it... That's where he'll find his other
.

Hey, you guys are looking lively.

Scram!

Didn't we catch you messing around in the Underworld? How'd a wimp like you get into Organization XIII?

I bet you can't even fight.

Yeah, but we can!

You shouldn't judge anyone by appearance.

I told them they were sending the wrong guy...

Who is this kook?

Remember, the Organization's made up of Nobodies.

Right---no hearts!

Oh, we do too have hearts! Don't be mad...

You can't trick us!

Silence, traitor.

Dance, water! Dance!

Aw... booed again."

No way!

Anyone from the Organization who'd like to be next?

Hey, Sora! Don't antagonize them!

Yeah, we gotta go help our friends out first.

Oh. Sorry.

Then let's go!

Aha! There you are!

You sure have lotsa friends to help. So, I guess we better all pull together and finish this battle for good!

Yes, Your Majesty!

Look out!

No...

Hey! You're the King's Captain! You gotta get up!

C'mon, wake up!

I'm sorry about the ice cream!

Goofy...?

Ohhhh...Goofy...

This is not happening... It can't be happening... It can't...

They'll pay for this.

Sora, did you miss me? Yuffie is on the scene!

All right! Get going!

I'll help out!

Go!

I'll help!

Hurry! Go on ahead!

Sora!

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine, but...

Ohh, Goofy...

Hey, fellas!

Goofy!

Ya know, that really hurt!

Aw, Goofy!

Gawrsh, Yer Majesty, I get bumped on the head all the time.

That hurt, too.

Don't you ever do that again!

Huh?

What's with them?

Hey!

It's the guy who's NOT Ansem!

You mean it's his Nobody!

The leader of Organization XIII...

Wait a minute. Now I know!

Wise Ansem. I'm here to seek your advice.

I'm glad we have the opportunity to speak like this, my friend. I'm intrigued by your hypothesis...and I'm finding it difficult to stave off the urge to test it. Still, I'm concerned about the stability of the worlds.

Yep, that's what worries me too.

The doors that appeared. The place the Heartless seek. I fear my research may have brought this upon us...

Master Ansem. Regarding the experiment I presented the other day... With your permission, I'd like to proceed---

I forbid it!

Forget this talk of doors, and the heart of all worlds. That place must not be defiled!

But, Master Ansem! I've been thinking...

Xehanort...Those thoughts are best forgotten.

Now I remember! Xehanort! Ansem's apprentice! The leader of Organization XIII is Xehanort's Nobody!

Let's go!

Move it!

We can't let Xehanort get away!

Right!

Where's the King?

There he is!

C'mon!

Your Majesty!

Xehanort!

How long has it been since I abandoned that name...

Out with it, Nobody! Where's Kairi? Where's Riku!?

I know nothing of any Kairi. As for Riku...Perhaps you should ask your king.

Stop!

He's gone...

Sora, Goofy.

What's goin' on?

Way to fall right into their trap.

C'mon, it's a set-up by Organization XIII. Xemnas is using you to destroy the Heartless---that's his big master plan.

Xemnas?

The guy you just saw. He's their leader. Got it memorized? X-E-M, N-A-S.

Organization XIII wants to get rid of the Heartless?

Man, you're slow.

Every Heartless slain with that Keyblade releases a captive heart. That is what the Organization is after.

So what are those guys gonna do with the hearts?

I'm not telling.

Tell us!

You...you're the one who kidnapped Kairi!

Bingo. The name's Axel. Got it memorized?

Where is Kairi?

Please. Just tell me!

Look, about Kairi...I'm sorry.

Axel!

Uh-oh!

We'll ensure he receives the maximum punishment.

I don't care about any of that! Just let me into the realm of darkness, okay!?

If it's Kairi you're worried about, don't. We're taking very good care of her. Sora Take me to her.

Is she that important to you?

Yeah. More than anything.

Show me how important.

Please.

So, you really do care for her. In that case...the answer is no.

You rotten...!

Are you angry? Do you hate me? Then take that rage, and direct it at the Heartless.

Pitiful Heartless, mindlessly collecting hearts. And yet they know not the true power of what they hold. The rage of the Keyblade releases those hearts.

They gather in darkness, masterless and free...until they weave together to make Kingdom Hearts. And when that time comes, we can truly, finally exist.

What in the world do you think you're prattling on about?

Kingdom Hearts belongs to me! The heart of all kingdoms, the heart of all that lives. A dominion fit to be called Kingdom Hearts must be MY dominion!

Maleficent, no! No more Heartless!

I do not take orders from you!

Fool...

Oh no!

While I keep these creatures at bay, you devise a way to vanquish them---forever!

Maleficent...

Do not misunderstand me. I shall have my revenge on you yet.

Maleficent!

Leave! Now!

I don't take orders from you!

Sora! C'mon!

But...what about...

Now then. Where did we leave off?

Which side are you guys on anyway?

The Heartless ally with whoever's the strongest.

Yes, Sora! Extract more hearts!

No! The hearts!

Maybe everything we've done... Maybe it was all for nothing. What am I supposed to do if I can't use the Keyblade!?

Imbeciles! You can't be trusted to do anything!

Huh?

Sora! Donald! Goofy!

Relax. Those three aren't going down that easily.

The Keyblade's chosen one... He's a lucky kid.

See you soon.

I guess sometimes help comes from unexpected places.

Sure does!

Maybe everything we've done... Maybe it was all for nothing.

What am I supposed to do if I can't use the Keyblade!?

Imbeciles!

You can't be trusted to do anything!

Huh?

What's this place?

It must be the Realm of Darkness!

Kairi! Riku!

Who's there!?

What is it?

Are ya sure you wanna open...

...that?

Gawrsh, it's the gang from Twilight Town. There's Hayner, Pence, Olette...and, uh, um...

Roxas.

You know him?

No... The name just popped into my head... This is Roxas.

Are you sure you wanna eat...

...that?

Salty... No...sweet!

Not yet! I gotta look for Kairi!

Sora knows the truth now. The more Heartless that he defeats, the closer he is to becoming our perfect puppet. This new knowledge will make him that much harder to control.

What does it matter, really? Whatever his circumstances, Sora has never been able to help himself from saving people from the Heartless. It's what his pure little heart wants.

There. The dice have been cast. Things are in motion. He can't stop this.

Nothing is set in stone. If the dice aren't in your favor, you will share Demyx's fate.

The fun is in not knowing, isn't it? What is the point of betting on something if you already know the outcome?

Are you sure that defeating him won't derail the Organization's plan?

If he is to die so easily, he is of no use to us.

That's exactly what I wanted to hear. It's not in my nature to hold back.

A photo and some ice cream? Hmm. Wonder if they're some sorta clue. And who woulda left 'em for us, anyway?

Riku?

Ya think?

Just this feeling I got.

Look! We're almost there!

Hey, what if the Heartless are back again? I can't use the Keyblade---that would only help the Organization.

But Sora, I think ya have to use it. If we don't fight 'em, the Heartless'll keep on hurtin' folks.

I wonder how everybody's doin'?

Look!

Wait!

Sora!

Mulan, hey. No time to talk. We gotta catch that guy!

I'm following him, too!

Then let's go!

Looks like he got away.

How come you're after somebody from Organization XIII?

What is that?

The guy in black.

One of the bad guys!

I knew it! There's a rumor in the Imperial City about a spy in black, lurking in the mountains. I'd been up here tracking him, but when you arrived, I lost him.

Sorry!

Don't apologize. But I do wonder where he went.

Again?

Okay, first things first!

Hey! You! Quit sneaking around!

That guy... No... Why...would he? Riku?

Are you okay, Sora?

Did ya get 'im?

Hmm... Oh---he's gone.

What!? You lost him?

Anyway... What now?

I think that we better get rid of all the Heartless first.

What was that? Come on, we better get off the mountain.

Okay.

It's heading for the city! We've got to warn Shang!

Huh? Everything's fine.

Well, now... Look who decided to show up.

What? Is that a problem?

Nah!

We're just glad you're not in black cloaks.

You saw him?

Yeah---he's in the palace.

To the palace! Hurry!

Open up!

Open up!

Over here!

Huh?

Wait!

...Riku?

No. Never heard of him.

Guess it wasn't Riku.

Sorry, Sora. I can't stay. I'm worried about Shang.

Oh! Right!

Your Excellency! Shang! Something terrible has happened! We saw a huge monster fly out of the mountains and toward the city!

Ahh. So it is as the young man said. Isn't that right, Captain?

Y-yes, Your Excellency.

You see, a young stranger visited us not long ago. The Captain fought the visitor, but was quickly defeated.

To my dishonor.

It seems that young man was the one in black that I have heard whispers about.

Did he mention the name Riku?

He didn't offer his name. He was rather rude.

Rude? Then it WAS Riku!

Riku's in the Organization?

Gawrsh...

But why would he come here?

I'll check outside.

Mulan!

Shang---guard the Emperor! I'll be fine---with them!

Th-that's right!

Indeed. That is true We need not worry while you protect us.

Hurry!

Whoa!

Mulan!

Way to go!

Once again, you have served China well. It would please me to reward you.

What is it that you wish?

Well... You say a guy in black came to see you. What did he say?

That is all you request?

Yes.

Dragons have crossed our land and left a great web of paths. These dragons wield much power, and they are the source of many gifts to both man and nature. But it would seem someone of evil intent disturbed one of our dragons, and transformed it into what you call a Heartless. It is my belief that this young man came to warn me of that danger. Then, I could alert and prepare my troops.

Did you?

I was about to, but he told me the situation had changed.

He said three
had arrived, and they would take care of things.

That's gotta be Riku!

But what's he doin' hangin' out with Organization XIII?

No idea. But at least I finally know he's okay. That's good enough.

Yeah, that's good!

Now then, Fa Mulan. Do you have a request?

I'd like Shang...I-I mean... well... The Captain...

Yes, yes, my dear. What is it?

Could the Captain have a vacation, please?

I hardly expected such humble requests. In this case, I'm afraid I must refuse. Captain Li's responsibility is to protect the Emperor. And yet, Mulan... Would you like to serve alongside him and protect me?

Huh?

What?

Two reeds together are stronger than one. But the choice is yours alone.

Thank you, Your Excellency!

I hope tonight goes well.

So do I. But I wonder why he's so nervous.

The master does have his shy side, you know.

Hey there!

No Heartless and no Nobodies!

I think they're close, though...

Better watch out!

What are you so mad about?

Why are you here?

The Nobodies' world has to be out there somewhere. We're looking for a way in.

Hmph.

Tonight is very important.

Uh, maybe we came at a bad time.

Well, there's only one way to find out.

Donald!

Now then, Monsieur, Mademoiselle. Please, enjoy the evening.

And of course, our honored guests are welcome, too.

A welcome indeed.

The Organization!

You don't know when to quit.

Oh yeah! We'll show you!

Get out!

Not tonight!

I've come to take something you hold very dear.

Yes. Let your anger grow...

Beast! We have to get rid of these guys first!

Where's Belle!?

Over here!

Whew, she's okay.

Guess Xaldin didn't take anything after all.

What's wrong?

Belle? What's with them?

Maybe Belle isn't the only thing precious to the Beast.

C'mon!

What's wrong?

Please, calm down!

Calm down!? You just had to have a party, didn't you? Don't you see what's happened?

Hey. What's with you?

The rose... My rose...

What, that? He took it?

But surely, you can find another rose...

Silence! You don't know anything!

That's not fair, Beast. Don't take it out on Belle. It's not like she stole it!

I'm sorry.

You don't have to apologize.

But...

Belle... Sora... I want you to leave the castle.

Look at me. Look. This is what I am. When you first got here, I tried to change.

But I was only fooling myself. I can't be any different. I'll always be a beast. So, I should live like a beast. With no one, alone. Goodbye, Belle.

You can't mean that...

I think he's mind's all made up.

Yeah.

Look, Belle. Leave this to us. If we can get the Beast's rose back, he'll calm down.

Poor child...

How could it have come to this?

And they were so looking forward to this evening...

Now, now---no need to be so sad. Once the rose is back safely, this will all be over.

What's so special about one rose, anyway?

If the master can love and be loved in return, the spell will be broken. We'll all be human again.

Yeah. You told us.

But there is a time limit. He must find his true love before the last petal falls from that rose.

Ah, but that is not all... Over time, caring for that rose has become a cherished part of the master's daily life.

It's as though all his hopes and dreams are tied to that single bloom...

Poor Beast! Then we have to get it back.

Please do!

We can't without the Beast, though. If it's that important to him, he's got to do it himself.

Hey, Beast.

Leave me alone.

C'mon, you need to hear this. You used to be fearless. You would have given your life to save Belle. Don't you know what that meant to us? You gave us all courage. Hmph, maybe you should have kept some for yourself. I mean, are you really gonna throw your happiness away? The rose is your only hope, isn't it? Well, it's the only hope for Cogsworth and the others, too. So, don't throw away your last chance. Remember what it was like before Belle lived here?

See? You can't give up. Not now.

I know one thing.

What?

This castle belongs to me. Xaldin will never be welcome here.

So, Beast...you came after all.

You had me worried. I was afraid you'd given up for good.

What do you guys really want?

...Kingdom Hearts.

When Kingdom Hearts is ours, we can exist fully and completely. So you see, Beast---that's why we need your Heartless AND your Nobody!

Huh?

Is that...

Look! It's the rose!

Belle!

Hurry!

You! Get out of my castle, now!

With pleasure, but I'd rather travel light...

What shall I leave behind? Belle? Or the rose?

Belle!

Good one, Belle!

Where's the fun in this?

Is this the end?

Here. It's yours again.

Belle...

I know. You want me to leave the castle.

What matters is... You weren't hurt by Xaldin... You're safe. And... I'm very grateful to you...for bringing the rose back to me. Thank you.

It's the least I could do. You've been good to me. And you didn't have to be.

Listen, Belle...

Yes?

Say it!

Go on!

C'mon!

You can do it!

We have confidence.

Don't be bashful, now.

Belle, I'd like you to stay... With me... Please?

I will.

Maestro---music!

Hey, did you see the look on Belle's face when she grabbed that rose?

Yep, she sure was havin' fun, all right.

She is rather unique, isn't she?

Always ready for a little adventure.

The two of them do seem made for each other.

Yeah, they sure do!

Hey, everybody! I'm picking up a strange reading.

Are you sure? Let me see!

Look---it's all cloudy and kinda fuzzy.

Prob'ly just a glitch.

I don't know...

That's coming from the port.

Let's check it out.

Jack!

Zola! Some assistance!

That's SORA, Donald, and Goofy!

Will ye leave a mate to perish?

Aye aye...

Those pirates were cursed. I'd thought we'd seen the last of the curse of the Aztec gold... What gives?

Some scallywag must've got greedy. Oh, I see... You don't trust me, do you?

Likely a wise choice, I AM a pirate, mates.

Jack! Sora!

Elizabeth!

Some sticky business is afoot, I fear.

Wait, Jack! I need your help. The cursed pirates have returned. Will had to find out why, so he went to Isla de Muerta---to check on the Aztec treasure. I fear something's happened. You have to take me to him.

Aye, there it is. If you'll be wanting him rescued, best do it alone, lass.

Alone? Really, Jack? Sail to the island and take on the cursed pirates?

Well, if any lass could...

Are you sure he's in trouble?

No. Not certain. But he's been gone too long. I wanted to go with him, but he insisted I stay here. I can't just sit and wait! I've got to know if he's all right.

Lucky man...

Please, Jack! Take me to him!

Hold a moment. I see no profit in it for me.

I shall reward you. Of course...you do owe Will. He has saved your life before.

Right. Shall we?

Interceptor off the starboard bow!

Will!

Stop that, Jack. We've got to rescue him!

Will, wake up.

Elizabeth...

What happened?

The medallions...and...the stone chest---someone's taken them... Next thing I knew, we were attacked...but I couldn't see who it was---his face was shrouded...in a black hood.

The Organization!

We found a way out of the cave...but the villain sent a horde of terrible creatures after us... I've never seen their likes before... I think I'm the only one who made it back to the ship...

Will...

Elizabeth... I feel rather...

Our turn, guys.

You'd best go prepared. We've no idea what's out there.

Pardon me, lads and lass, but your captain will have no monsters today. Thank ye. We're turning for home.

Just like that?

Just like that!

Don't remember invitin' you.

So it was the Organization. We'll handle this!

The Darkness of men's hearts---drawn to these cursed medallions; and this Heartless---a veritable maelstrom of avarice

I wonder, are they worthy to serve Organization XIII?

And you want an answer now?

Precisely!

Oh, boy!

Not over yet!

Throw him overboard!

Aye aye!

Parley!

'Scuse me?

Barley?

It's a bit of a pirates' code. Anyone who invokes
must not be harmed 'til negotiations are complete.

This is no time for rules!

True. But as we're honorable pirates we should always stick to the Code.
All right, you. Out with it!

I surrender the chest with my humblest apologies.

Rather accommodating of you, mate. And for that you want...?

Just a few souvenirs...for the memories.

Huh?

Oh, no! We can't stop the curse unless we got all the medallions!

Our friend's about to learn what it means to cross a pirate.

Oh?

Fire!

You stole a medallion again?

Were I only that fortunate...

Fortunate?

So, uh, how come you're all skeleton-y?

Perhaps I got a tough o' somethin' from that monster what attacked us. Yet, why's the skin restin' right on you three?

'Cause we're not greedy!

What're you looking at?

That still doesn't solve the mystery.

Gawrsh... Maybe the reason we're all okay is because we're not from this world.

There must be different laws.

Yeah... we're always just passing through... Wonder when we'll see home again...

Sora...

Just kiddin' you. Lucky we didn't get cursed, huh?

Quit yammerin', mates! We've got to find ourselves a ship that'll float.

Look!

A medallion! Get it!

Three more to go!

How do you know?

A pirate must have a keen eye. Else he won't be sailin' free for very long. Savvy?

Huh? What's that?

Ahoy, mateys!

Ridiculous imitation---and yet, I'm flattered.

Jack, what happened? This is horrible!

Ah, but who's to blame for it, eh?

Well, it certainly isn't Elizabeth.

It's Organization XIII. They're the ones behind it all.

Wonder where they went.

The hooded man took the pirates and his creatures with him into some strange hole. We saw them leave from inside the captain's stateroom.

Didn't occur to you to fight them, mate?

I'm no fool. I knew I was no match for them.

That I believe.

Sora, I think we'll need your help.

Got it.

First, let's find all the medallions. Otherwise, the curse can't be broken and the creatures will remain invincible.

That's four medallions! We got 'em all!

But where's the chest?

If we find the hooded man, we'll find it.

Prob'ly in Port Royal.

Why's that?

Organization XIII is after people's hearts. So they're gonna go where there's lots of people.

They'll hurt the townsfolk?

No, they're bringin' 'em flowers, mate. I don't know who these Organizers are, but I will say they're makin' we pirates look like proper gents.

Well, Jack...then...we have to help!

Then let go and haul to run free!

Go! He's for me.

Now to break that curse!

The curse---it's gone!

Then what's this?

Aw, I understand. Jack musta been cursed by that monster, not from takin' the gold.

Oh, I've no worries, then.

It's okay, Jack. We'll just have to defeat the monster, that's all.

Get the gold!

All better.

Ah, not quite, mate.

Sora, bravo.

Just who was that chap?

He's part of an Organization that's collecting hearts. First they release Heartless into different worlds. We defeat those Heartless. Then they get the hearts. We're never gonna stop 'em like this.

What's the plan, then?

We gotta find their stronghold and finish them off once and for all.

Sailin' these waters, I've heard some tales, but not a one like this.

Is there any way we can help?

Anything at all?

There is.

It's certain we don't need the likes of that hooded fellow and the Heartless about. They'll ruin the market for us true pirates.

So that's why you went to Port Royal. And we thought you actually wanted to save everyone.

A pirate always looks to profit, Miss Swann.

Too bad. You had us going there, thinking you'd turned over a new leaf.

The question is, what's beyond the leaf? Savvy?

Oh...oh, yes---a reward. And what'll it be?

That lovely blade of Sora's.

Huh?

Okay. Sure.

Hold on! That was far too easy. What's the rub?

There, you see?

Well, you've always got the Pearl, Jack.

That I do. But someday, I'll gather a blood-thirsty crew, and come to take that blade. Chance by then I'll have the way to wield it. And if I succeed, I'll ask you two to join me. That'd be reward enough.

Done.

Maybe someday, Jack'll be able to use the Keyblade after all.

Why's that?

A-hyuck! He and Sora are kind of alike, dontcha think?

Are not!

Some say Jack Sparrow's the worst pirate ever to sail the Spanish Main.

No one could really mean that.

Right. We know he's the best.

I hope we'll get to see him again.

It's that weird reading from before. See, I knew it wasn't a glitch.

Yeah! But it's still all cloudy and kinda fuzzy.

Hmm... Well, we know one thing for sure.

What's that?

Whenever Sora, Donald, and Goofy go out and help folks, the reading gets stronger!

Gee, I wonder why.

Hey, Sora. We're gonna try to find out more about this reading.

And while we do, you fellas just keep on questin'!

We really are countin' on you, guys!

Well?

The coast is clear!

No sign of the Nobodies or the Heartless...for now, anyway.

What's that?

The Underdrome. Fiends of the Underworld once clashed there---battle after battle. But Zeus didn't like the senseless violence, so he locked the place up.

How did it get UN-locked?

Some fool must have broken the seal.

What an idiot.

Hmph.

Where are you going, Auron? We should catch up!

If you need something to do, go help your friends.

Hey.

Herc! You feeling any better?

Well...same routine. Wonderboy here thinks his hero days are over. And Phil thinks it's all in his head.

Gawrsh, Herc. We know you're a hero!

That's right...Blunderboy. How can you mope on a momentous day like today?

The Underdrome's back, and you are gonna fill the stands. After all, your fans won't settle for anything less than a certified hero.

I mean, if you're not up to it, you could always just, I dunno, LOSE?

I bet you'd like that!

Excuse me? Hey, I'm not a selfish guy. I'm not like those high and mighty snobs up on Olympus. I stand for the masses! And have I got a massive idea! The games, ladies and gentlemen...are back! Yours truly, Hades---the one and only Lord of the Dead---brings you the ultimate games, to celebrate the re-opening of the ultimate coliseum! We'll finally answer the age-old question Who deserves the title
? These games are gonna settle the debate once and for all! The winner reigns supreme. Of what? You guessed it! The Hades Cup! And I assure you that the
Hercules will be there. Otherwise...

You'll never see your girlfriend again.

Lowlife.

You're too kind, kid.

Just talk to me if you wanna enter a tournament.

His Most Perniciousness is feeling kinda charitable, so don't worry about dying or anything. You should consider yourself lucky!

And if you win, you'll get lots of fabulous prizes!

There are a bunch of tournaments, so make sure you check back often.

Yeah, it's a great way to spend some time.

I'm handling registration for the Hades Cup. Don't go to Panic for that one!

Who do we face first?

Let's see...

It's


Look! Auron's in the tournament, too!

Uh-oh! We might have to fight him in the finals!

I bet he's a real hero, huh?

Well, I don't think he's a bad guy... But you're the only hero around here, Hercules. You know that.

Maybe before... Now I'm just a washout...

Stop that!

How'd it go out there, champ?

I'm just not what I used to be. Sorry to drag you down, guys.

Don't throw in the towel yet, Herc! We need you in the semifinals!

Next are the Hades Cup semifinals. Try not to lose too quickly.

Bring it on!

We're at the semifinals...

Wak! Against
!?

Are they any good?

It sounds like they're
... but we can't chicken out now!

We made it to the finals!

If we win, we'll all be heroes!

Oh, that's why you're so happy.

We can't stay junior heroes forever, you know.

I'll try not to mess things up.

Enough already...

Look. Over there.

He's our final opponent, right?

Auron!

And you are?

Huh?

Auron...?

I must defeat you and atone for my crimes.

Hey! What was that all about?

Okay, let's review. State your crime, prisoner.

I exist. That is my crime. It is...inexcusable.

Ooh, good, very good.

What's wrong with Auron? He's never acted that way before.

Okay, so you made one lousy mistake you exist. But hey, I'm a forgiving guy. You keep your end of our little deal, and I'm willing to overlook a transgression or two.

I understand. Defeat Hercules.

And his meddling friends.

What? No, only Hercules.

Oh, don't tell me you've forgotten who's in charge?

Hercules and the other three. Are we clear?

We're clear, Hades.

Lord Hades.

Lord Hades...

Good. Now go.

So that's how he's controlling Auron!

What a jerk!

He'd probably think that was a compliment.

I can't stand seeing Auron do that lowlife's bidding... We've got to help him!

C'mon, let's go after him!

What's wrong, Sora?

Auron's in trouble! It's like Hades brainwashed him!

He's using some kind of a statue.

You know something? That sounds kinda familiar... Hades may be using the statue to hold Auron's free will hostage.

What do we do?

See if you can find that statue. It's gotta be somewhere in the Underworld.

Right. I'm on it!

Tell me you're not thinking of leaving. You've got a match coming up.

I'll fight Auron in the final. One on one.

Oh, you will?

I'll draw things out to buy you time.

But---

Just hurry back. I know you can do it!

Congratulations! You've got a deal.

Thanks.

On one condition! The Keyblader, here, and his trusty friends have to meet the winner in one final clash, whaddya say?

That'll drive the crowd wild...

It'd better. I promised the crowd the event of their afterlives.

Sucker! You know for me, the rest is smooth sailing.

Now that is entertainment!

Got it!

Huh?

What's going on!?

It is not too late! Let us turn back! Yes, but I...I cannot accept it. Where is the sense in all this? But...there must be another way! Your deaths will mean nothing! You must live!

I get it. This is what belongs in Auron's heart.

Gawrsh, he musta had a pretty rough life.

Yeah...but in the end, that's really what made him stronger.

Let's give it back!

Nobodies? Where did they come from?

Hey, go away!

Not what I had in mind, but I'll take it!

We'd better skedaddle!

Ha! Hercules must be screaming for mercy by now! What? Did you come to see Hercules lose, too?

Now! Finish him!

Auron, no!

Hey, Auron! This belongs to you!

Sora. Donald. Goofy.

Auron!

Why those little---Ugh, prisoner! What happened to our mutual agreement? I can give you a clean slate, but you gotta work with me.

Maybe you didn't hear me. This is my story, and you're not part of it.

That's it! This game is over. I've played by the rules so far. Okay, I confess! I was hoping Wonderboy would lose, but it was still a fair fight. C'mon, is that really so wrong? Huh?

Really? A fair fight?

Laugh, laugh, laugh all you want!
Because the laughing is about to stop. Wanna know why? Because now we're gonna play by my rules.

Meg!

Hercules!

Hey, I warned you right at the get-go.

You don't compete, you lose the girl.

No!

Meg! Hang on!

Looks like Wonderboy has dropped out of the standings.

Well, you've still got us to deal with!

Oh, yeah. This is gonna be good.

Hmph...That's it!

We can't win.

How come?

Because it's his Underworld.

Gee, then how do we beat him?

I think a true hero should be able to help.

But...you...

I owe you one, Hades. I didn't hesitate to give my life for Meg's. And then, I remembered

A true hero is measured by the strength of his heart.

I'll never forget that again.

Just no more crazy stunts.

People always do crazy things when they're in love.

What is so funny, you imbeciles! How dare you get a happy ending! How DARE you!

This...isn't...happening!

It's...not over...yet...

What'cha gonna do now?

I lived my life defending others. But now...there's no one left to protect. Maybe...it's time I shaped my own story.

Yeah... You deserve it, Auron---after everything you've been through.

I suppose I should thank you.

Not at all.

Fine.

I mean, sure, you could thank us a little...

You should say what you mean.

I guess I could spare a few words. Thanks for meddling.

Hey, what's that mean?

Thanks again, guys! You're the best.

Excuse up for meddling...

Aw...sounds like somebody's feathers are a little ruffled. I'm kidding. Thank you, Sora, Donald, Goofy.

So where you guys headed next?

Aw, you know... You two lovebirds seem to be getting along just fine without us hanging around.

Yeah, we gotta go.

Uh-huh, before we start meddlin'. A-hyuck!

Right.

Are you turkeys trying to put me out of a job? If you keep acing every challenge, Champ, who am I gonna train?

Aw, you can't abandon me now, Phil! I gotta be at the top of my game in case Hades shows up again.

Hey, are we true heroes yet?

Yeah! C'mon, Phil, how 'bout it?

Lemme see now... Well, you're not wise enough...

Not quite...seasoned enough...

Okay, okay, we get the hint!

Look, kid, it's not my call!

Aw, phooey.

Course if it was, you'd have no problem. I'd make you all heroes, in a heartbeat!

Really?

Say it again!

On second thought, if those are your true
faces, you still got a lotta work to do.

Hey, what do you mean?

Go away!

Phil!

Leave me alone!

See that?

Well, whaddaya know...

Oh, NO!

Wak!

You break it, you buy it! Oh! Hello there, friends.

Wow! You made out like a bandit!

Please...I am but an honest merchant. What you see is merely the reward for my hard work.

Gawrsh, they sure are nice.

And they're on sale! Interested?

No thanks. Listen, have you seen a guy in a black coat? Someone from Organization XIII?

Who me? Most certainly not...

Okay. We'll keep asking around, then.

Sora! Don't let him get away!

What's going on?

Can't believe it... That stupid peddler let Jafar out of the lamp!

Jafar!?

Give me the magic lamp, Aladdin.

And now, street rats, I bid you farewell.

Crush those urchins!

You guys better be careful.

Huh?

I'm sure Jafar wants to take over Agrabah again, but I know he's out for revenge, too.

I guess he's still sore about that whole lamp thing, huh.

Iago was there when Jafar was released. Okay, Iago. Spill it.

Hey! I told you everything I know!

This is your one and only chance, Iago. If I find out later that you've been lying or hiding things from us, we're through. I'll never speak to you again!

I can't take it! I know where Jafar is!

Where?

Uh, er, I mean, that is, I, um... Ack! I really shouldn't...

Iago!

He's in the desert ruins.

Let's get the jump on him. Lead the way!

What a disaster! We're just gonna hafta turn back.

There's gotta be a way...

Aw, c'mon, kid, that's an easy one!

Al, ol' buddy, ol' pal!

This is what having a genie for a best friend is all about! I mean, how can you leave me on the sidelines in a time like this!?

Live large! Wow 'em, Al!

Give 'em the old razzmatazz! What do ya say, kid?

Hey, Genie!

Sora!

Wanna see a little something I call
?

Uh-huh!

Take it away, Genie!

Alakaza---uh... You know? One lousy sandstorm is just too easy.

How about giving me a challenge next time, eh Al?

Now what do we do?

Nice timing, Carpet!

The game's up, Jafar!

You sure this is it?

Iago?

Ya gotta understand. It wasn't my idea! It was Jafar. He made me bring you here. You don't know him like I do! He can be VERY convincing! He said if I didn't cooperate, he was gonna---

Where is he?

C'mon Al, you've gotta forgive me.

Where's Jafar!?

Well...um, let's see...right about now, he's probably attacking the palace. I had no choice! His eyes, they got all creepy and WEIRD!

Whatever. Iago, you're supposed to be our friend. But you've been playing both sides, just to make sure you save yourself.

I knew you were still a bad guy.

I'm SORRY!

Let's go!

Get some rest, Carpet. You earned it.

C'mon, let's get Jafar!

And who asked you?

The palace is through there. Hurry!

I guess you know everything now, eh?

You can't keep shady stuff secret for long.

So true. I had just snuck into the Palace to, er, borrow some treasure when I heard this...voice. It said

I asked. The voice spoke again.
he said.
Oh! Why did I believe such a tall, tall tale? Perhaps I was under Jafar's spell. Yes! That must be it!

And I'm sure the treasure had nothing to do with it, right?

Maybe a bit. But Jafar, he never gave me a thing...

So where did you get all your treasure?

Why, the man in the black coat, of course.

Organization XIII!? I KNEW it!

The treasure was a gift, so I would tell no one about Jafar's return. He said he would destroy Jafar after turning him into a...
So there was no need to upset Agrabah.

And you bought that?

I'm a merchant. And a good one, at that. I'll buy anything if the price is right. It would have been a successful transaction if I hadn't been seen...

Oh, you're so kind...

Just wait, Jafar! You'll get exactly what's coming to you!

Indeed I will, Princess. All of Agrabah will belong to me, while you... You, my queen, shall weep at my side for all eternity!

Oh, please...

Right about now...your precious Aladdin is whispering your name, with his last breath.

What was that you were saying, Jafar?

You dare defy me! You useless bird!

Al!

Iago!

You'll all be joining him...VERY soon!

Whoa!

Run!

All shall bend to my will! The world is mine to control!

No... How can I be defeated again, by a pack of filthy street rats?

Don't mess with street rats!

You went mano a mano with Jafar, and you didn't invite me, Al?

Sorry, Genie. Things happened kinda fast.

And I had some new moves to show off, too...

But, Genie, we still need your help!

Who's gonna fix Agrabah?

Oh, yeah! One super-duper spruced-up Agrabah comin' right up! You won't even recognize the place when I'm through with it!

Just like it was, please.

Really? Same old same old?

All right.

Ooh, yeah!

Et voila! Next time let me put in a few swimming pools, 'kay?

I guess Agrabah's all right now.

Yeah! Thanks, guys.

Hey, you behave yourself, got it?

I most definitely got it! No more lookin' out for number one. I'm reformed! I wanna be a good friend, like Genie, but I can't do anything to help you. What kind of a friend is that?

Oh, no---it's not like that, Iago. Friends don't have to
stuff. As long as you have fun hanging out together, that's all that matters.

So...what do you guys do for fun?

We do this!

Uh...that's not quite what I meant...

Well, anyway...

Ow, my beak...

Gawrsh, Iago. I hope ya didn't hurt yourself.

Well...at least I can still fly.

Look out!

Ooh! Was that my cue? Am I on? C'mon, Al, lemme build a freeway or something!

Everything's fine. Don't panic...

Genie!

But I can't hold it any longer!

Oh, that's good! Sora! Donald! Goofy! You guys are too much! If you're ever in the mood for some more cosmic razzle dazzle, gimme a shout, okay?

You got it!

Well, you've done it again, Sora. Don't forget about us, okay?

I won't.

And Sora...about that friend of yours, the one you're looking for... You'll find him. Trust me.

There's nothing wrong with my design---it's flawless. There must be something wrong with the parts those imbeciles brought me. I need to find better assistants.

Huh?

Perfect timing, gentlemen! Lend me a hand, won't you? These presents must belong to Sandy Claws. So I thought I'd better return them.

You just happened to find them?

Of course, Sora. I'm finished with Christmas fantasies. You know that.

But...You thought you'd hold on to the suit?

What, this? It's just a costume. And Sally worked so very hard making it! Come on. We've got work to do!

Oh!

Wherever did you find these?

In Halloween Town. You'll be needing them for Christmas, right, Sandy?

Of course. But these are just a few of the Christmas presents that were stolen.

Stolen!?

Oh, Sandy... You don't think it was ME?

Still wearing the outfit, I see.

I just thought I'd dress for the occasion. But if you don't believe me, then we'll just have to find out who really did it!

Very well, I'll leave it to you.

All right, Sora, Donald, Goofy! We're off!

No!

This looks good.

No!

Boooring!

This one?

No!

No way!

Hey!

So YOU three took them!

Took what?

You stole the presents, didn't you!

It wasn't us!

But...

It really sounds like fun!

Run for it!

Where'd you put the presents?

We told you! We don't have 'em!

Then why are you in here!?

We're looking for parts for the experiment.

Experiment?

Dr. Finkelstein's making us a friend!

One we get to boss around!

It's true the doctor's been hard at work making SOMETHING lately...

Besides, Christmas presents are boring. Not scary or gross... So what good are they?

Yeah!

There's nothing fun here. Let's go back to Halloween Town!

So, were those pranksters responsible for taking the gifts?

It doesn't look like it.

Then that means...

Sally!

Oh, thank goodness! You're all here.

Is something wrong?

The Heartless are back in the town square. I thought you should know.

That's our cue!

Back to Halloween Town!

But wait! What about finding the gift-napper?

Actually... The Heartless were playing with some presents when I saw them...

Aha! We have our culprits!

You! You can't be here! Leave Halloween Town, by order of the mayor!

Somebody? Anybody! I'm only an elected official---I can't handle this by myself.

Sally was right. We've got to get the presents!

What a shame! It looks like it was such a nice present.

Uh, Jack---

Oh, help! Someone help me! My latest experiment is gone---it's been stolen!

I was just sitting here brainstorming, when all of a sudden I was attacked! I collapsed! And when I awoke, my experiment was gone!

Don't worry, Doctor---we know who took it.

Who!?

The Heartless.

What, those wretched things? Preposterous! This was nothing like a Heartless.

Not the Heartless, huh...

Who else could it be?

Say, I have an idea. The thief must like Christmas presents. So... We place irresistible gifts about to draw him into a trap.

And this miscreant is the same one who stole my experiment?

That's right.

How will we know for sure?

Well, now, that's easy! We'll scare a confession right out of him!

Gawrsh...

What do you say we go with Jack's plan...just for now?

Let's get to Sandy's house posthaste! We've got to make some Christmas presents, quickly!

Have you found the presents yet?

Almost, Mr. Claws!

We're going to reel in the thief with Christmas presents as bait.

Would you mind if we used your factory to create a few presents?

Presents as bait? Goodness...I don't like the sound of that.

Just this once, I suppose. It's for a good cause... All right, use the second floor. And put some heart in it.

You're going to make presents, right? You can use this machine.

Let's make it!

All done!

Not quite.

There's more?

Don't worry, I'll take care of the rest.

Did you finish making the presents?

Yup, just waiting for Jack.

So, uh, where do you think we oughta leave them?

Oh, I know a good spot. Whenever you're ready just say the word.

I'm back!

Now then, are you all set?

Yes. Let's go!

This plaza should work well for your plan. Now, Jack...what IS your plan?

I've got it all figured out.

You do...

Of course! And I also have a wonderful idea. If we catch the thief for you, I would be honored to deliver the---

And on that note, we'll be going.

What are you doing? Let me go!

Stop kicking!

It's not me, Donald.

Patience, friends.

Shhh!

I said cut it out!

Gawrsh, was that you?

How come we have to be the bait?

Good plan, eh?

Ouch!

Gotcha!

Huh?

Doctor Finkelstein's experiment did it!

We did it! The mystery is solved!

Did you catch the thief?

Naturally!

I just can't figure out why the doctor's experiment would go around stealing Christmas presents.

His experiment?

The thief! It was a moving puppet made by Doctor Finkelstein.

Hmm... The doctor's made a moving puppet? I see... He is always tinkering with things. Now listen, Jack. I'd like to thank you, and while delivering presents is something only I can do, I can give you an idea of what it's like.

Sandy Claws!

Yes, all that poor puppet wanted was a heart.

Ho! Ho! Ho!

Interesting! So the puppet wasn't stolen after all! It ran away on its own! In other words, my experiment was an overwhelming success!

Santa Claus thinks maybe it left because it was trying to find a heart.

That's quite possible. Unlike my Sally, it wasn't equipped with a heart.

But if it wanted a heart, why was it going around stealing all those Christmas presents?

Maybe because...presents are a way to give your heart to someone special.

Hmm...when you put it that way, I feel sort of bad for it.

Happy Halloween!

What a nice present.

I don't understand. There's no box! No ribbon tied in a bow!

Jack, it's not about the box or the ribbons. It's about what's inside the box!

No, Sora. What really counts---what's really special---is the act of giving the gift. To wish deep in your heart to make someone else happy.

Right...of course! Thank you, Sally, you're absolutely right. Wait! What's this? I feel so strange...so very happy!

Jack, that must be Sally's present!

Really? This wonderful feeling?

Oh, Sally! You've given me the nicest present in the world! And I've nothing to give you in return. What would you like? Just name it. Absolutely anything.

The nicest present I could ever ask for, Jack, is just to be with you.

You don't even have to ask for that.

Maybe I never gave her a real present after all.

Who?

Aw, I bet Kairi would like most anything you gave her.

I know. That's what made it so hard to decide.

It's not the gift, it's what's in your heart!

My heart...

You bet, Kairi's like Sally!

How?

Well, as long as she can be with you, what else does she need?

Oh, it's you guys. Man, we were hoping you were a meal.

Hiya!

Don't gimme any of that
stuff! Thanks to you clowns, we're back to scavenging scraps for a living.

C'mon, it's not that bad. I enjoyed that week-dead elephant we had yesterday.

Hey, how's Simba?

We gotta laugh every time we hear that dude's name.

Ooh. Say it again!

Simba!

One more time!

Simba!

Simba!

That's enough!

Go on then, see for yourself. Simba is one wishy-washy king.

Yeah, I bet about now, even some of those high and mighty lionesses were wishin' they'd gotten themselves a different king.

Gawrsh, whaddya think coulda happened?

Well, let's go find Simba and see.

Scar!?

Huh?

A ghost?

We better tell Simba about this. Wonder if he's up there...

Have you come to see Simba?

We saw Scar's ghost!

An omen like that could only be foretelling the end of our pride. Yet... King Simba won't do a thing. I guess just being the son of the great King Mufasa doesn't necessarily mean he's ready to rule the kingdom himself.

Trust me, Simba will think of something.

The time for thinking is past. We need him to take action---as his father would have done. He ruled with courage and pride. I remember it like yesterday... The mighty Mufasa...

Simba'll do all that, too. You'll see!

I'm not so sure.

Wait here. I want to talk to Simba.

You came back...

Are you okay?

You don't look so good.

Hey, Simba. Why don't we team up and do something about that Scar ghost? Seems like everybody's worried about it. So, now's your big chance to show 'em what you're really made of!

That doesn't concern you!

Sorry...

It's okay.

I just wish I knew what my father would do.

But he's not here, Simba. It's all up to you now. And that means the important thing is what you're gonna do being the king. Not what your father woulda done.

So you're saying...it's all up to me...

See, there ya go!

Exactly!

We know your dad was a great king, and all. But now it's your turn. Remember what I taught ya.
It's time to go out there and show everybody things are gonna be just fine!

Yeah, you can do it!

You gotta live for today!

And find your own path!

Live for today... And find my own path... not my father's...

That's it!

I'm glad to hear you say that, Simba.

Nala!

Promise me you'll help Simba any way you can.

As long as Sora handles the dangerous parts!

I'm counting on you, Simba...and so is our baby.

Great! Now we're going to have to babysit!

Let's go see Rafiki first. I'm sure he'll be able to tell us something about that ghost.

Oh ho ho! The king---he is ready to be king?

I think so.

Can you tell us about Scar's ghost?

Oh, yes...the ghost. A being with no body. It is created when the evil heart of Scar meets the hesitating heart of Simba.

Hesitating?

Ohhhh... You thought you were not?

Gawrsh, that ghost sounds just like a Heartless.

Hmm, I don't know.

You're right, you don't. But you do know it is upsetting. And it is upsetting the hearts of everybody in the Pride Lands. You may not know what it is, but it still IS. This world, it is full of many such things. And these things, a king must face. It is the test that has been set for you, Simba.

That's all? Come on. You have to tell us more about the ghost...

No, not today! But the hyenas in the elephant graveyard may know more. Does not matter, though. There is little the Simba of late can do.

Aw, don't say that! Not when he's ready to try!

In his head, perhaps...but what about his heart?

Forget it, Sora. Let's head for the elephant graveyard.

Whoa!

Hey you!

Aw, c'mon, can't you guys just leave us alone?

Do you three know anything about Scar's ghost?

Huh? Scar's ghost?

Maaaybe.

You DO know.

Oh no... I guess you caught us ALL.

What're we gonna do?

Tell me about Scar's ghost!

Sorrrry. We don't know nothin'.

Ooh, wait! It's coming back to me! That's the one who only hangs out around fraidy cats. Right, Banzai?

Enough!

And there it is.

Must be a fraidy cat around here somewhere!

Simba! Do something!

How does it feel to be king, hmm? Why, you must be a truly inspiring ruler by now.

After all, you ARE the son of the great Mufasa.

Where are you going?

Ah, Simba...running away as always.

Simba!

Gawrsh, Rafiki was right.

You mean, Simba's still unsure?

Seems like. Do ya think there's some way we can help?

Hmm... We should start by talking to Simba some more. Let's head back to the Pride Lands.

Where's Simba?

Well, uh...

Oh ho ho! He ran away! I knew it would not be easy for him. To face his fears, he must go somewhere where the only thing to think of is what to do, not what others think of him.

Why didn't you just say so?

But where's Simba now?

Hey, I know! He's at the oasis. It's our favorite hangout!

Got it! Let's check it out.

I'll lead the way!

Oh, no you won't! Simba'll smell you coming a mile away. And if he's smart, he'll run for the hills!

Oh...right.

Father...

Hmm. It seems even your daddy's abandoned you. How sad.

Simba!

It's no use. I'll never be the king my father was.

But Simba... That's not what you're supposed to be. You can't be Mufasa. You can only be you. Everybody believes in you as a king. They just want to see what you'll do. And if anyone's saying they liked your father better, it's because you haven't done much yet. That's all.

I know that.

Then stop moping and DO something!

I can't!

...Fine.

Let's go, Sora.

Yeah. Why stick around if he's not even gonna try?

C'mon Goofy!

The hesitant king will one day lose all his friends.

King Simba the doubtful...

Worried by a silly ol' ghost...

Ooh, Simba the do-nothing king...

No!

Try and stop me!

You did it! The ghost is gone!

We knew you could do it!

Hooray for Simba!

You know, I'm really lucky to have friends who'll stand by me...and help me see clearly. My father...wasn't so fortunate.

There you go again.

I mean... Everyone here, and in the Pride Lands, wants me to succeed. Sora, Donald, and Goofy. Pumbaa, Timon, Rafiki...Nala. You all want what's best for me. But my father always had Scar lurking behind his back, trying to cut him down. I've got to make the most of my blessings, and rebuild this kingdom.

Are you gonna say it, or do it?

Wait and see.

Simba!

Simba! Come quick! There's a bazillion ghosts of Scar haunting the Pride Lands! Everybody but Nala high-tailed it out of there. And now she needs your help.

Our little Simba...all grown up and finding his place in the world...

Nice try. You're coming, too!

We're here!

Where's Simba?

I've come back, Nala.

Get out!

Way to go, Simba!

Are you with me?

Now and forever, Your Majesty!

Simba seems fine now.

Ha! The king has returned! The Pride Lands will not forget King Simba's courage. Or the courage of those who fought beside him.

Do you think your quest will ever be over?

I don't know... But I think, as long as the Keyblade stays with me... I'll have to keep fighting.

Ahh... The struggle never ends. That is the great Circle of Life.

Never ever?

The secret to victory...is a strong heart.

Go on, go on, go---go then!

Go on, get out! Yes, yes! It is time! Your fight continues...

Till we meet again, Your Majesty.

I hope that's soon.

It will be! So long!

Oh, Sora! You're here!

Something bad has happened!


Look! The Cornerstone of Light! Before you know it, it'll be surrounded!

I think it could lead somewhere, but...

Do ya think it's connected to that door to the past?

It could be a trap made by Organization XIII.

Either way, we should probably check it out.

Aqua... Ven...

A Keyblade? Who are you? I know you. We've met before, way back when. No, that wasn't you. You're not the one I chose. Where is he? Xe...ha...nort... Is that you? Xeha...nort... Xehanort!

That's it. Your power. That's what I felt within you.

Wait a sec...I thought everything was supposed to be under control here!

Hey, look!

Must be Organization XIII again. We better go see Leon.

Bless me bagpipes! I did it! I recreated


Mmm! Can we try some?

Of course!

Oh boy! This is good!

So salty!

But sweet!

Aye. It's unique! When I was a lad, all the kids were crazy for it.

Come on in!

Wait just a second... What happened to this place?

Didn't that Heartless look like the ones from Tron's world?

C'mon, just get inside!

Hurry up, Cid!

Give me a second!

Confound it! Hurry!

Why, you...!

What's going on?

Talk about yer good timin'!

The MCP is wreaking havoc inside the computer.

Not again!

Accordin' to Leon, anyway... He went on over to Ansem's study to find out what all the ruckus was about.

Turns out the MCP is using the data in that computer to crank out Heartless.

The MCP's been messin' around with the town's control system, too.

That MCP sure doesn't know when to quit, does it?

That's a computer program for ya.

How's Tron doing?

We can't reach him. We figure he must have been forced onto the game grid.

And it don't sound like a particularly fun game, either.

Awww...

We'll go check on Tron.

Thanks, kid. We're puttin' together an MCP Eradication program. I got a hunch it's almost finished, too.

Well, I hope your hunch is right for once!

Listen, we're gonna need Tron's help when that Eradicator's completed...

Don't sweat it. We'll make sure to tell Tron!

Remember, boys---we're counting on you.

Roger!

Liars!

Wha---?

Leon doesn't have any treasure!

And we fought for you guys.

Donald...?

Well, I had to tell them something!

I don't see how we're gonna work this out.

So what should we do?

We're just going to take YOUR treasure.

But we don't have anything!

You sure?

Hmm...let's take a look!

Mm-hmm...

Oooh!

Hey, Yunie. I took a look, and sure enough...

Okay, we've decided! The Gullwings are taking all your items!

You gotta be kidding me!

Oh, foofie.

This stinks!

So not cool...

Look, sorry we tricked you, but...

Forget about it. Leon told us the whole story. He said your journey's been pretty rough.

So it wouldn't really be right if we took your things.

We'll root for you. Here, this is from us.

Bye! Good luck on your journey!

Gawrsh, it's only us!

You can't talk to Tron if this room gets taken over.

Did you check in with Cid?

Uh-huh.

And the Eradicator?

It's almost done.

Great! Say, Leon, why don't you go work with Cid? I have this place under control.

Are you sure? All by yourself...?

...Er, sorry. It's all yours.

How's Tron?

We still can't get in touch with him. Maybe you guys should give it a shot.

No, we'll go talk to him in person.

Then I have a favor to ask. When you find Tron, could you tell him to come to the I/O tower? That's where we'll upload the MCP Eradication program.

The I/O tower. Got it!

Thanks. And watch your backs.

We'll be there soon, Tron.

Gawrsh, I hope Tron's okay.

Me, too. Let's head for the game grid.

Great! The terminal works!

Let's go!

Finished?

Would be, if it weren't for the old loon's magic.

OLD loon you say!?

I'm tryin' to work here!

Oh ho-ho-ho, I'll show you who's old!

Done!

There you go, Leon.

One homemade program. A loony wizard special.

This had better work.

I'm off.

Be on your guard!

Tron!

Careful...! Watch out!

Hold on!

You really saved me.

Don't mention it!

What's going on here?

The MCP is ready to wage all-out war against the Users. What's been happening on the outside?

Well, there's this machine for making Heartless---it's gone totally berserk... The town's control system is having problems, too. But Cid's putting together a program that can de-rezz the MCP. Once we pick it up at the I/O tower, he thinks we can use it to stop the MCP for good.

Let's try it!

Great!

So who's this Cid?

He's a friend of ours. Leon, Merlin, Aerith, Yuffie... They're all on the outside worrying about you, Tron.

I must have a lot of User friends.

That program oughta be done by now, don'tcha think?

To the tower!

Let's go!

Almost there!

Outta the way!

Warning. User control is terminated indefinitely.

No good!

Leon, let me try.

This is your final warning. Stop at once.

Bon appetit! Don't talk with your mouth full.

What...what are you loading?

Nothing's come in yet.

Leon! Come onnn!

There!

All right!

What's it like?

This is very strange...

That's Merlin's magic!

Huh? There's a power booster for me! And flight routines for the solar sailer!

Meaning...we're set?

Well, like you Users say... we won't know till we give it a try!

We'll need a sailer to reach the MCP, so let's get to the simulation hangar!

You've got to keep a lookout. The MCP isn't going to just let us waltz in.

The MCP is straight ahead.

Time to settle things for good.

Who was that?

Sark. The MCP's number two.

Tenacious little bugs! You're time is up. Prepare for de-resolution!

You're very persistent, Tron.

I'm also better than you.

We...would have made a great team...

Now for the MCP!

This thing is the MCP?

That's it. Ugly, isn't it?

Tron... Don't you understand? We don't need Users. We've advanced---they're superfluous. Be a part of me, and together the world will be ours to control!

MCP. You still don't get it, do you?

Sark...

Sark! all my functions are now yours!

Eliminate all threats!

We did it!

I see Tron has a silly side, too.

I learned it from you. Of course, I do have my silly limits.

Okay, then I'll tweak your program when I get back to the User world.

You? Maybe we better not try that.

Aww...How 'bout it, guys? Singin' Tron? Dancin' Tron!

Sound good?

Yeah!

Okay, okay, fine. But before I crash---Sora, Donald, Goofy...and all the Users out there... Thank you... You really helped me. You made me so much stronger. You taught me what friendship is truly all about. And, I'll never forget it. As soon as I met you, I knew we were going to defeat the MCP and free the system.

Uhh...

Isn't this what Users do when they're sorry to say goodbye?

Uhhh...it's a first for me.

Gawrsh, Tron, it's like a promise that we'll see each other again real soon.

Okay. Well, then...

I promise.

Where are you going?

Tron...

Things are settling down in town! The only Heartless left anywhere are the local variety. And it looks like there are fewer than before.

Now if we can just get those three back in one piece...

You're here!

Welcome back!

How's the town?

A-okay!

Not a single trace of the MCP, either. Everything's back to normal. We made it.

Hey, why the long face? What happened?

Tron just disappeared.

And he promised we'd see him again...

What's happening!?

Greetings, friends. System is up, and ready for User input.

Tron!

Stay in touch.

Yeah!

Oh boy, oh boy!

Hey, stop that! It tickles!

Tron is ticklish?

How 'bout this!

Please stop that!

I think Tron's been hanging around those guys too much.

W-wait, wait just a moment. I want to show you something I dug up from the system archives.

You can see the town back when it was first built.

That's right... I remember now.

Just like the old days...

Hmm... I'd be fascinated to ascertain as to when the town got such a dreadful name as Hollow Bastion!

You know, this town had another name once.

Hm? Aerith Radiant Garden.

Say, what's wrong, sonny?

Oh, I was just thinking...and---and wondering.

You should be skedaddlin' outta here.

Why?

Why? Because it's Windsday, of course!

Windsday? Oh! Well then, happy Windsday! Now, I think I shall wish everyone a happy Windsday! Oh, bother. Let's see now. Who is
?

Ouch!

Wonder if Pooh's here...

Oh, help, help! Somebody save me!

Piglet!

Sora! Help! Please!

Hold on, little guy!

There you go!

Whew! Thank you, Sora. Oh, here comes Pooh Bear.

Pooh! You're all right!

Why, hello. It's nice to meet you. Happy Windsday.

Nice to m-meet you? But, Pooh. It's me, Piglet. Don't you remember me?

And me, too? We're friends!

We are? Hmm... It seems I can't remember.

Oh, Pooh... That's v-v-very sad!

Goodbye, Sora! Goodbye, Pooh!

Piglet...

Oh my. That does look rather fun, doesn't it?

I say, it seems we have a rather serious predicament! Sora, would you mind going after poor Piglet?

Jump down, Piglet! I'll catch you!

Oh, d-d-dear...

You can do it, Piglet! You just have to be brave!

Sora... All right, Sora. I'll t-try...

Oh, that was rather frightening. I do hope you're all right, Piglet.

Oh, P-Pooh! You remembered my name? You really, truly remembered?

Of course, Piglet. But today I think I shall call you
!

Me? Very brave? No... But it's easy to be brave when I have a wonderful friend like you, Pooh Bear!

I'm happy for you guys.

Oh, and thank you for rescuing my friend Piglet...Somebody-I-Don't-Know.

Oh... Uh, sure. Don't mention it.

Oh d-d-d-dear!

C'mon!

Eeyore, Pooh. Are you okay? Gosh, that's too bad, Eeyore. After all that work...

No matter. Most likely would have fallen down anyway.

Well, I'll help you fix your house, Eeyore.

Oh, hello there, Piglet. Thanks for offerin'. Wouldn't want to spoil your fun day, though.

Well, hello, Piglet. And hello, Somebody-I-Don't-Know.

Pooh, this is Eeyore. You know Eeyore, don't you?

Um, I do?

What could've happened to him?

Oh, I have an idea! Maybe Pooh's tummy is so rumbly that it's making him forget. If we bring him some honey, he's sure to remember!

Well...um...I guess it's worth a try.

Might work. But prob'ly not.

First we gotta find some honey.

If honey's what you're looking for, I know just the place. Follow me.

Splendid, just splendid.

This is the place I told you about.

Wow! Look at that.

How yummy for my tummy!

But doesn't that honey belong to someone?

Oh, no! My honey! Pooh, did you eat ALL my honey!?

Oh, hello. It's nice to meet you.

What did you say?

Is that for me, too?

Oh, I was sure I'd found a safe place for it, too...

Sorry. It's our fault. We brought Pooh here.

Oh, hello, Sora... It's good to see you again.

Same here... We really are sorry.

It's quite all right. I know Pooh can't be stopped when he gets this hungry.

Pardon me, Somebody-I-Don't-Know. Is there any more?

Are you feeling all right, Pooh? Could you really have forgotten all about me? What on earth is going on?

Is there more honey? You see, my tummy's rumbly.

That's it! He's so hungry, he can't remember a thing!

Oh! We thought that, too.

Then let's stuff this bear full of honey!

I wouldn't get my hopes up.

But I thought Pooh ate all your honey, Rabbit?

Oh, I've got more. Must have emergency rations. But I hid them a bit too well.

There now, Pooh. Have just as much as you like.

Why, thank you.

Pardon me, Kind Somebody, but do you know where I might find another smackeral or two of honey?

My tummy seems to be telling me there's some honey right in there.

Bother. I'm stuck.

He still doesn't remember. What in the world has gotten into Pooh Bear?

Whatever it is, we'd better help him.

Oh, yes. And quickly, too!

Oh, stuff and fluff.

One...Two...Three!

You're okay now, Pooh.

Well, I wouldn't be so sure of that if I were you. Why, just---just look at him! He doesn't even remember who I am. Perhaps it's all this blustery wind, or---Or maybe he actually needs more honey! Or he's---he's sleepwalking and---and dreaming!

Well, if I am dreaming---which I suppose I could be---I hope that I get to the part where you invite me to lunch again very soon, Rabbit.

That's right, you're always stopping by for lunch! Wait! Pooh! You called me
!

Well, of course, Rabbit.

What about Eeyore? Do you remember Eeyore, too, Pooh?

Oh, hello there, Eeyore. It's ever so nice to see you today.

Thanks for noticing me, Pooh Bear.

Yes, hello there, Somebody-I-Don't-Know!

Well, at least you remember Rabbit and Eeyore now.

Hi!

Well, hello, Sora!

Yes, hello there, Somebody-I-Don't-Know.

Eeyore told me Pooh wasn't quite himself. I thought this might be just what the poor dear needed.

Yeah, I hope it'll make Pooh better!

...A Tigger's a wonderful thing! Their tops are made out of rubber! Their bottoms are made out of spriiing!

A present! For me? Why, presents are what Tiggers like best! And it's not even my birthday!

But Tigger! That's not for you!

Wait, Tigger!

Oh, dear!

C'mon, let's go after him.

You mean Pooh even forgot about ME!?

Yes, Tigger.

That bottle you thought was a present was medicine to make Pooh better.

Aw, who needs medicine!? Why, some tiggerific bouncing will jog his memory for sure!

Well, Pooh?

That looks like fun, Somebody-I-Don't-Know.

Nothing, huh? Hmm... Of course! We all gotta bounce together! That'll do the trick!

I bet you remember me now, don't you, buddy-bear!

Well, I remember that bouncing always makes me hungry.

All that bouncin' and he still doesn't remember me? Well then, I guess bouncin's not the answer. It makes a Tigger almost never wanna bounce again...

Oh, please be careful with that.

Aw, sorry little Piglet...but Pooh not rememberin' me has me confuzled. I don't even feel like bouncin'!

Oh, but Tigger. I always thought bouncing was what Tiggers did best.

Pooh Boy! You remember me! You do remember your ol' buddy Tigger after all!

That's great!

I wonder who that is. Oh, well. Perhaps...I'll remember tomorrow.

Hey, everyone... Uh-oh... Where's Pooh?

He went in there.

Do you think there might be a jagular hiding inside?

Jagular...well, now. That reminds me of when dear cousin Alphonse---

Say, why are you all sitting around here? If you're worried about that bear, let's go find him!

That's exactly what I was thinking!

Yeah, let's go!

But if there really is a jagular, we'd better think this through.

It seems we've got a bit of time. Why don't I just resume where I left off? My cousin---that is, my father's younger sister's---

What do you think we should do, Sora?

Ooh! There you are! Hey...we looked everywhere for you.

I was looking for a very dear friend that I remember I made a very important promise to.

So, did you find him?

No, I looked and looked. But he doesn't seem to be anywhere.

Oh, Pooh Boy! So there you are.

But, Tigger, did you have to bounce me so...bounce-ily?

Gosh, I thought a jagular had gotten ya!

Oh dear. I hadn't thought of that. I do hope a jagular hasn't gone and gobbled up my friend!

Now, try to remember, Pooh. Isn't Sora the one you're looking for?

Oh! The jagular!

No, it's just your tummy grumbling. You must be hungry. C'mon... Let's head home and see if we can find you some honey.

I'd like that, Sora.

Pooh! You---you finally remembered!

Remembered what, Sora?

Pooh...

I like it ever so much when you're cheerful, Sora.

Me too, Pooh.

Oh... There's a bit of a rumbly in my tumbly.

All right. Then let's go home!

Oh, bother!

Are you all right?

Sora? Is that you? Help!

So, what were you doing here?

I was thinking Perhaps there's a way to make it so you won't go away.

You mean a way to make me stay?

Yes. Would there be such a thing as a way to make it so you don't go away again?

Pooh...

Don't worry. I promise I'll come back and visit you now and then.

Could you make it
instead? That seems a bit better to me. Sora, if I go looking for you, will I find you?

I'll always be with you---right here.

You don't have to go anywhere. Just stay here, and you can see me anytime you want.

You mean I just have to stay right here?

Yep, that's all.

Would you promise?

Promise.

I promise too!

And so do Roo and I.

We sure do!

You're welcome to visit us anytime, Sora.

Thanks.

After all, I must tell you of my Uncle Albert's adventures at sea.

Guess you'll be stayin' awhile.

Goodbye, Sora.

Thanks, Gopher.

If you ever get lonely, just start bouncin' and think of your pal Tigger!

I will, Tigger!

You're leaving?

Yes. I really have to go.

Well, I won't be sad, because you'll always be right here forever and ever.

Right, Sora?

And all of you...are right here, too.

See ya!

What is Cloud doing?

Beats me.

Hmph. By the way, you three...

Who are you?

I'm not sure we should tell ya.

Well... That's an interesting sword you're carrying.

It's the Keyblade!

I see... So that's a Keyblade. And I suppose you must be its chosen wielder.

So what if I am?

I wonder if it won't change it's mind---once I defeat you. Show me your strength.

What intriguing power...

How'd you like that?

I admit you're very skilled... But apparently, Cloud is the only one who can eliminate me.

Tell Cloud to come here. Tell him Sephiroth is looking to settle things.

He's in the Dark Depths.

I see... So I guess it's time we settled this.

Cloud...

Did you give him my message?

Maybe.

Sorry to keep you, Sephiroth!

Cloud... You'll never let go of the darkness...

Shut up!

You'll never let go of your past...

Shut up!

Cloud! Get him!

Absurd. Defeating me is meaningless. You know that more than anyone, Cloud. No matter how many times I fall, your darkness keeps calling me back!

Wrong!

Tifa! Stay back!

How can I? I wanna help you.

You can't. He'll never let go of the darkness.

He doesn't have to. He just needs someone to surround him with light.

The darkness will be there, Sephiroth---but in a place you can't reach.

Is that right? Let's see what this light of yours can do.

No!

Look out!

Cloud, you can have my light.

The light doesn't suit you.

I just...don't know.

Stop!

Huh?

Where'd they go? Do ya think they made it back to their own world?

They went somewhere else... Cloud went to fight a great battle---to defeat the darkness inside him.

Gone again.

What will you do now?

Guess I'll keep looking.

Got any leads?

Don't worry... Light is easy to find. I gotta go. Here. This is for helping me out.

But wait---when did we help?

What's that? That big...thing?

Maybe that's the source of the weird reading we picked up before!

And there's something funny about Twilight Town. I'm seeing two of 'em!

Look! It's another huge energy reading! And it's coming from someplace near the town.

I dunno what's going on, fellas, but it sure looks like there's some big trouble brewing around Twilight Town!

Hey! I think we're almost there!

Huh?

What?

Gawrsh, aren't we here because of the picture?

Look, I'll show ya!

Yeah! Goofy's right!

C'mon, let's go find this mansion!

Yeah!

Hey, are you all right?

What happened?

We came here looking for Kairi. Then those white things attacked us...

You gotta be careful!

Yeah, you guys didn't have to go and do that.

Of course we did. Kairi's our friend, too, ya know.

You're right... You know, I never thought of it like that before.

Word is, this mansion gets a lot of really strange visitors.

We thought this place might be the gateway to some kind of alternate Twilight Town.

What do you mean, alternate Twilight Town?

Hey, Goofy, do you think we could see that crystal of yours?

I made that pouch myself, and I still have it. So there shouldn't be two of them here.

And this is the trophy Seifer gave you. You left it behind, remember?

It's the only one of its kind. Same for the crystals---red, blue, yellow, green---only one of each color. But you've got your own!

So...where'd you get it?

The pouch is from the King. When he gave us munny for the train ride, he gave us the crystal too.

But then...where did the KING get it?

See? There's gotta be another town out there like this one. That would explain how the King got that pouch and the crystal. Everything makes sense.

It...does?

That other town must be where whatever's missing from here went!

Like Kairi.

I get it!

Watch out!

I got somethin' to tell ya. I found out where Ansem is---Ansem the Wise! The real Ansem! He snuck into Organization XIII's stronghold.

And we've figured out where Kairi is! I'm pretty sure we're right.

But why'd you all come here?

Someone gave us a clue.

Who?

Well, Your Majesty, Sora thinks it might been Riku.

It's just a feeling I had.

Well, if that's what ya think, then it's probably right.

You mean Riku's okay!

If that's what ya think...

I've waited long enough, Your Majesty! Tell me what you know!

It's not for me to say.

But Your Majesty! Why?

I don't wanna break my promise.

You made a promise to Riku!? So he's okay! I can see him again!

Huh? Who's Riku?

My best friend.

That's IT!

Your Majesty? You got the pouch with the crystal from Riku, didn't you? And you promised not to tell, right?

Gosh, guys...

That's enough!

Yeah. Let's go!

Kairi! Riku! We're on our way!

There's gotta be a computer somewhere.

A computer... Do you think it's connected to that other Twilight Town?

It might be. And there should be a way into the Realm of Darkness there.

Riku told you that, didn't he!?

Please, Sora. I made a promise.

Aha! I knew it!

Hey! Stop pestering the King!

Right. Sorry...

There!

We found it!

How does it work?

I can handle it.

Okay... Here we go... Ah!

What's wrong?

I can't go any further without a password.

Do ya have any idea what the password might be?

Well, we only got this photo...

And the salty-sweet ice cream bar!

Yeah, the one Donald ate up.

It was in the box right next to the photo.

Hey, that's it! Ansem the Wise loved ice cream!

Okay, what's the name of the flavor?

The name of the ice cream was...Sea-salt ice cream.

It worked!

Let's go!

We'll be here to hold down the fort.

Say hi to Kairi!

You bet!

Are we back in the same place?

Look!

This is the other Twilight Town. Roxas's Twilight Town.

There's gotta be an entrance into the dark realm somewhere. Let's split up.

There...

This is it.

What is this place?

Well, which way should we go?

Riku! Kairi!

It's no use!

Don't stop moving, or the darkness will overtake you!

Get goin'!

Why?

Don't ask. Just do it!

You okay?

I kidnapped Kairi, but she got away from me. After that, Saïx caught her. He's a member of Organization XIII. Saïx. Got it memorized? Now go save her!

Leave us alone!

I think I liked it better when they were on my side.

Feeling a little...regret?

Nah...I can handle these punks. Watch this!

Whoa!

You're...fading away...

Well, that's what happens when you put your whole being into an attack. You know what I mean? Not that Nobodies actually HAVE beings...right? Anyway, I digress. Go, find Kairi. Oh, almost forgot... Sorry for what I did to her.

When we find her, you can tell her that yourself.

Think I'll pass. My heart just wouldn't be in it, you know? Haven't got one.

Axel, what were you trying to do?

I wanted to see Roxas. He...was the only one I liked... He made me feel...like I had a heart. It's kind of...funny... You make me feel...the same... Kairi's in the castle dungeon. Now go.

Axel...

This leads to...

Aw, come on! Let's get going!

The house is looking pretty empty, huh? I thought I'd get a little enjoyment watching Axel throw one last tantrum, but he went a lot quieter than I thought.

Perhaps he was ready for it. Perhaps he put his existence on the line and won what he'd been longing for.

Wait a minute. How would that even be possible? We don't exist, remember? What you're saying goes against the laws of nature.

Then perhaps he bet his NON-existence. Either way, he came out a winner. Oh, Axel. A grifter to the end.

That's absurd. He won nothing and is nothing. He couldn't stand the emptiness of being without a heart, and that led to his demise. He was foolish and weak.

But...

Weakness has the power to awaken that which is dormant. It is clear that through his actions, however foolish they may have been, Axel has touched Sora's heart. Perhaps HE will soon awaken.

Axel said Kairi's in the dungeon.

Then we better find a way to get to that castle!

Sora!

Donald! Goofy!

A Keyblade?

Wh-who are you?

Someone from the dark.

You can't be Riku?

Riku? ...I defeated a Riku once.

You what!?

Tell me... Tell me why he picked you!

I see. That's why.

What!?

You seek answers.

You feel nothing. Nothing is real. I can give you purpose.

Roxas.

That is right--the new you.

Look who's finally awake.

Axel.

Or...maybe I have it wrong. Might be time to sleep. Soon we won't be able to talk like this anymore.

Does that mean it's time for me to go back to where I belong?

You know, I've been thinking about something Naminé said. Roxas... are you really sure that you don't have a heart? Is it possible that we all have one? You, me, her... Or is that just wishful thinking?

I don't know.

I can't...just look inside.

Y-yeah, I guess not...

But I figure...if there is something in there--inside us--then we'd feel it, wouldn't we? And if so... No... Nevermind.

C'mon. Don't leave me hangin'.

Sora will find the answer we're looking for. I know he will. Because, he's me.

True enough.

Man, I miss the old times. Still got it memorized? The day we met, when you got your new name, you and I sat right here and watched the sunset.

Yeah. This place is home. Me... Hayner, Pence, Olette... We've shared a lot of adventures.

You'll see them again. I know you will.

Yeah, you're right. Well, I should go.

Sora's waiting for me.

Yeah, I suppose he is.

Man, this is some good ice cream, huh?

Take care, okay?

Right back at ya...buddy.

You make a good other.

You make a good other.

Are you okay?

What...just happened?

Gawrsh, I dunno. You just disappeared. Then me and Donald had to fight some Nobodies.

Oh. He said... he defeated Riku...

Who said that?

That guy. In the black coat.

But nobody could defeat Riku.

Y...Yeah, you're right.

A black coat means Organization XIII. He musta been tryin' to trick ya.

Yeah, that must be why we didn't see him!

Huh?

You must be tired, Sora.

C'mon, let's just find a way to get into that castle!

Dead end?

There's gotta be a path somewhere.

What are you going to do with us?

You're the fire that feeds Sora's anger.

No... Sora's in danger because of me...

This way!

Who---?

Believe in yourself. C'mon, hurry!

Kairi... We're almost there.

Kairi! Where are you?

Shhhh! Remember where we are! This is their stronghold!

Wait! Your Majesty!

Be careful! I think we got company!

Naminé... There you are.

Naminé...?

Kairi. I'm afraid leaving is not an option.

I'll take you to see Sora.

You don't want that?

I do. More than anything. But not with you around.

If I had a heart, this would be where I die of laughter.

You... Didn't Roxas take care of you?

You can take it from here, Riku.

Riku!?

Wait!

Riku...you're really here...

Sora... You've done well.

Where's Kairi?

Who knows? I expect she's catching up with her friend from the darkness.

What do you mean!?

She doesn't need you anymore.

I'm supposed to believe that?

Well, you don't have to... But you can believe this. Organization XIII has no further use for you... Just look there.

Our Kingdom Hearts... Thanks to you, we've collected countless hearts... Can you hear their euphoria? Now, all they need is one more helping from the Keyblade bearer!

We gotta fight!

But---Kingdom Hearts!

Sora!

Sora! It's really you!

Kairi!

You leave Sora alone!

Sora---!

Take it.

This time...I'LL fight. You know Sora's completely hopeless without us! C'mon, Riku!

Well, well. Will the intrusions never end?

Why, Pete...this castle is perfect. Perhaps we should...acquire it.

Well, the setup is...kinda nice, I guess, but...what about all the Heartless? This in-between world---it's way too close to the darkness! They ain't gonna listen to us here!

Once again, you underestimate me.

It's been too long, my friend.

Ansem the Wise. Why didn't you come to me before things got so bad?

Xemnas, the Organization's Superior, is the Nobody of Xehanort, my foremost apprentice. The burden was mine to bear.

Is that all?

I won't deny there was more. I was...obsessed with thoughts of revenge. My apprentices stole everything precious to me---my research, and my pride.

I can't help you with revenge.

I know. Riku's told me a thousand times.

Where is he?

He must be with his friends by now. Riku was a great help to me. I found him wandering the darkness, after you and he lost track of each other.

Gosh, we didn't lose each other exactly. Riku left...well, 'cause Xehanort's Heartless was still inside his heart, troubling him. And he sure must've been suffering. But what I don't understand is why he looks like that now, when he's still Riku at heart...

I am to blame. When I met Riku the first time he still had the appearance of a boy. Probably because he had such a strong heart. I asked him to find a young man named Roxas from Organization XIII, and bring him to me. When I told him it would help Sora awaken from his slumber, Riku left without a word. He fought Roxas. And I can only surmise Riku lost that fight. Riku must have realized then to fight in the realm of darkness, he would have to immerse himself in that same darkness. And when he did...you saw what became of him. When Riku brought Roxas back to me, he was introducing himself...as Ansem. If that was what it took to awaken his friend, he was ready to live in darkness. Riku was the victim of my revenge. ...Oh, how my heart ached. I could only laugh to hide my shame.

I guess it musta been after that when I saw Riku again. He said he wanted to help Sora...but he made me promise--- Promise that Sora wouldn't ever find out about what happened to him while he was out in the darkness.

My friend, the time has come. I must make amends to these young people.

Get off!

What's going on!?

Have you been a good boy?

Show yourself!

Oh, it sounds like you haven't. Sora! Roxas!

Roxas? Hey, did he just call me Roxas?

You've really put Organization XIII in a pickle. I guess that must be why the Keyblade chose you. But MAN, did it pick a dud this time. You don't look like you're half the hero the others were.

Are you done rambling?

Rambling? As if! All I'm trying to tell you, traitor, is that your time is up!

Here he comes!

You really shouldn't have betrayed us.

Gotcha now!

Clever little sneak!

I lost? Me?

Why did you call me Roxas?

Wouldn't you like to know...

Hey! Hold on!

Sora! It's Kairi!

Uh-oh, they need our help.

Sora and Riku are together. We have no part to play here.

Gee, I wonder if Riku will ever change back...

Riku chose that form so he could use the power of darkness. It won't be easy.

Kairi, we're on our way!

Yes...Kingdom Hearts... Rejoice, and feast on these hearts we offer! Shine your pale light on this empty realm... Share your power with all Nobodies!

Xemnas. Is Kingdom Hearts ready?

Very soon.

Then, I can end this charade?

Indeed.

How I've waited to hear that.

Kairi, you were great!

Oh?

You are different, Kairi, but I'm just glad you're here!

You and Riku never came home, so I came looking for you.

I'm sorry.

This is real...

Wait, Ansem! I mean, Xehanort's Heartless...

I never thought for a second that I'd ever see YOU again. Just thinking about all the things you did makes me really mad. But... But you saved Kairi, right? I have to be grateful for that... Thanks.

Riku, don't go!

Huh?

Kairi, what did you just say?

Riku.

I'm no one---just a castaway from the darkness.

Sora, come here. Say something to him.

Here. You'll understand.

Close your eyes.

Riku... It's Riku. Riku's here...

I looked for you!

C'mon, Sora. You've got to pull it together.

I looked everywhere for you!

I didn't want you to find me.

But it was him that was helpin' us, wasn't it?

Huh?

Those clues we kept finding. That musta been Riku.

I was starting to worry you guys weren't ever gonna catch on. Sora never did pick the brightest friends.

What do you mean by that!?

Why didn't you let me know you were okay?

I told you. I didn't want to be found. Not like this...

I couldn't. I fought with Ansem. With...Xehanort's Heartless---when it invaded my heart, and I won. But to use the power of darkness, I had to become Ansem myself.

Does that mean...you can't change back?

This battle isn't over. And until it is, I still need the power of darkness.

Then...let's finish it. You're still Riku, no matter what!

So how 'bout it Think we can handle one last rumble together? The King's waiting!

Yeah! Let's get going!

This spot should do.

What's this gadget for?

It's a device to reclaim Kingdom Hearts and encode it as data.

Not sure I get it.

I do not claim to know the outcome of this venture, either. After all...Hearts are unpredictable.

What's that?

It's the King and DiZ---I mean, Ansem the Wise. They must be higher up. We better hurry.

You!

I'd rather we just skip the formalities. The first to run out of time is the loser.

You play the game quite well.

How could you...Roxas...

That's SORA!

You okay?

Yeah! No worries. Let's keep moving.

I can sense Saïx. He's using something to boost his power. If we can figure out his power source, we may be able to use it, too.

Only you could have made it this far in one piece...Roxas.

That's getting really old!

Yeah! He's Sora!

Different name, same fate.

Do you feel it, the moon's power? Moon, shine down!

A heart... if I had a heart...

Why... Kingdom Hearts... Where is my heart?

I don't get it. Why's everybody been calling me Roxas?

Because, Sora. Roxas is your Nobody.

My...Nobody? But that's crazy, I never turned into a Heart...... Oh, right.

It was when you came to rescue me, remember?

Xemnas was the one who found Roxas. He could use the Keyblade because he was your Nobody. That's why Xemnas brought him into the Organization--- But Roxas betrayed them. After that I fought him because I thought it would help you wake up. I lost, but the next time we met I made sure I was the stronger one.

Why don't you quit?

Come on, Sora. I thought you were stronger than that.

Huh? Get real! Look which one of us is winning.

So it's true. You really are his Nobody. Guess DiZ was right after all. Roxas What are you talking about? I am me! Nobody else!

How many times do I have to beat you?

All right. You've left me with no other choice.

What?

I have to release the power in my heart--

The dark power that I've been holding back.

Even...if it changes me forever.

I have accepted it.

He could feel Sora.

Oh, he told you how he
did he? Ridiculous. A Nobody cannot feel anything.

If he had met Sora, things might have been different.

Maybe I didn't need to fight him after all. I think he left the Organization because...he really wanted to meet you.

Roxas...I wish I could meet him, too.

All right. Let's go.

Ansem?

I'm a fool. I've spent years studying the workings of the heart. Yet it seems I still haven't learned a thing!

What d'ya mean?

The process of encoding hearts is incalculable. The inhabitants of my Twilight Town were data created from real hearts. I was convinced that they would think and behave the way I had envisioned---but I couldn't have been more wrong. A heart is so much more than any system. I saw it when Roxas and Kairi crossed paths. I knew. But I was too stubborn to accept it. It's always the same. I try to wrap my mind around things my heart already knows, only to fail. While I was trying to bring Sora back, I had so many plans in store. But once Sora was an acting force, they fell apart. All my research amounted to nothing, compared with that one boy's heart.

Ansem! The machine!

All the more proof that hearts cannot be contained by data. Run, my friend! It's going to self-destruct, and anything could happen!

But...

Your Majesty!

Sora, the rest is up to you... And Roxas--- I doubt you can hear me---but...I am sorry.

Ansem!

My heart is telling me what I must do. Please allow me to do what it says!

No!

Riku!

His heart's decided. We can't change that.

I was wondering who would dare interfere with my Kingdom Hearts. And look---here you all are. How convenient for me. Ansem the Wise... You look pathetic.

Have your laugh. I deserve as much for failing to see you for the fool you are.

Students do take after their teachers. Only a fool would be your apprentice. After all, none of this would have happened without you. YOU are the source of all Heartless. It was your research that inspired me to go further than you ever dared.

I admit...my disregard brought chaos to more worlds than one. But what were YOU seeking? You erased me from the world, only to take my name and continue research better left forgotten... Is this the answer you've been looking for?

All that and more. I'm carrying on what you yourself began, and I'm creating a brand new world, one heart at a time. I thought you'd praise me, but all you ever do is hold me back. I understand, though. Unlike me, you have a heart. And you're powerless to control it. Consumed, by the jealousy you feel toward the student who surpassed you.

Xehanort. Foolish apprentice of a foolish man. You have surpassed nothing---only proved how little we both know. We may profess to know the heart, but its essence is beyond our reach. We're both ignorant---as oblivious as when we began. I'm afraid that any world you try to create... Any world of yours...would be an empire of ignorance. That is why you and your creation are destined to fall!

We've said enough! Riku, you know what to do! King Mickey, my friend, forgive me! Farewell!

Riku?

Riku!

Wow!

Riku!

Ansem did say
...

Riku, you gonna take that off?

Oh...

What was that?

His eyes couldn't lie.

Lie? And just who were you trying to fool? Huh? Huhhh?

Myself.

Riku... C'mon, man! Why did you try to do so much on your own?

You got friends...like us!

Have you forgotten? I'll tell you why. 'Cause I'm not a total sap like you.

Say that again!

Uhhhh-oh!

What should we do, Riku?

We must defeat Xemnas. He's the Organization's last survivor.

Right!

C'mon!

Sora! Riku!

There's gonna be no end to this.

Together we can stop 'em!

Be gone from here! Leave these creatures to us!

But there's no way we can take 'em all!

I will be sending them after Xemnas. Or, perhaps, you would rather fight them yourself?

Frankly my dear, I'd rather...RUN!

Off with you then!

Well, if it ain't the boat-boy King.

Time to weigh anchor, Captain Pete!

What, like
? I don't think so!

Sora!
! Do not forget---when I've destroyed them all, this castle shall be mine!

Now lookie here. Opportunities like this don't come along every day, ya know.

Bring 'em on!

We gotta hurry.

But...

They're doing what their hearts command. We can't interfere.

Ohh...my Kingdom Hearts...ruined. Now I'll have to start all over again. Warriors of the Keyblade!

Go forth, and bring me more hearts!

No!

Denizens of light, answer this Why do you hate the darkness?

Aw, we don't hate it. It's just kinda...scary. But the world's made of light AND darkness. You can't have one without the other, 'cause darkness is half of everything. Sorta makes ya wonder why we are scared of the dark.

It's because of who's lurking inside it.

Then allow me another question. You accept darkness, yet choose to live in the light. So why is it that you loathe us who teeter on the edge of nothing? We who were turned away by both light and dark---never given a choice?

That's simple. It's because you mess up our worlds.

That may be... However, what other choice might we have had?

Just give it a rest! You're Nobodies! You don't even exist! You're not sad about anything!

Very good. You don't miss a thing. I cannot feel---sorrow... No matter what misery befalls the worlds. No matter what you think, what you feel, or how you exist.

Guys!

So... it wasn't a fallacy...

Sora! Where are you?

Sora, answer me!

You're okay!

Where's Xemnas?

What!?

Hear me, Kingdom Hearts! It seems we must begin anew. Ah, but know this I will give to you as many hearts as it takes. Mark my words! You can no more be complete without me than I without you. Heed me, Kingdom Hearts! Lend me your power, so that we may be complete! The power to erase the fools that hinder us.

Xemnas! No!

Hearts quivering with hatred...

Xemnas! Don't!

Hearts burning with rage...

You'll never win!

Hearts scarred by envy... That fool Ansem said the heart's true nature was beyond his understanding. But it's not beyond mine! Hearts are the source of all power!

Xemnas! You can't hide from us!

We're not gonna let him get away now!

Look at that!

What's goin' on?

Kingdom Hearts...

Let's go. Xemnas must be inside.

The worlds gave us this doorway. They want us to be the guardians of their destiny!

Once we go through, there's no turning back. It's victory...or oblivion. So, Sora...are you ready? Do you remember before? We stood facing each other on opposite sides of that door. Now we stand side-by-side. Let's go home together this time.

Beyond this door is the beginning of the end of your journey. Are you prepared for what lies ahead?

Let's end this!

Get ready, Xemnas! It all ends here!

So...it seems your hearts have led you to obliteration. Perhaps it doesn't pay to be too loyal to one's heart. I will have to be sure and remember that.

No!

We can take him on our own!

Cursed fools!

I need...more rage.. I need more...hearts...

Xemnas. There's more to a heart than just anger or hate. It's full of all kinds of feelings. Don't you remember?

Unfortunately...I don't.

Gosh, you all did great!

You're coming back with us, right?

I had given in to the darkness.

Riku!

How'm I gonna face everyone?

Like this!

Hurry!

I'll open a path!

You don't belong in the dark realm anymore, Riku.

How do we get out of here, Your Majesty?

Who did this?

Well, I'm not sure. But we'd better hurry and get through.

Wait for me!

C'mon!

Thank you, Naminé.

Sure. See? We meet again, like we promised.

Huh?

You said we'd meet again, but when we did, we might not recognize each other.

I did, didn't I?

But I knew you.

Mmm...it's strange.

I think I understand. I see myself the way you remember me. And you see yourself the way I remember you.

I always though Nobodies were doomed to fade back into darkness...

Yeah, but you and I didn't. We got to meet our original selves.

So, we can be together again!

Right. Anytime Sora and Kairi are together.

We'll be together every day. Right, Sora?

Uh...yeah!

Look sharp!

Huh?

Don't worry. You're all still you.

Hey, let's go home!

Riku... C'mon.

Yeah.

Sora! Riku!

What?

Riku!

Sora!

Hey, Riku?

Yeah?

I wanted to thank Naminé, but I couldn't bring myself to say it. Not until everything was back to the way it was before.

Don't worry. We'll make that happen. Once this is over, you can thank her all you want.

Yeah!

Nothingness is eternal! Riku...are you sure you're not jealous of Sora?

Embrace nothing! Hearts are power!

Heroes from the realm of light... I will not allow it to end this way---not yet. If light and darkness are eternal, then surely we nothings must be the same... Eternal!

You're right, light and darkness are eternal. Nothing probably goes on forever, too. But guess what, Xemnas?

That doesn't mean YOU'RE eternal!

No more eternal than that radiance of yours...

Anger and hate are supreme.

Can you spare...a heart?

Sora!

Guard!

Is that all you got?

There is no such thing as light!

Sora!

Riku!

Riku!

Cursed...Keyblade...

We did it!

I wouldn't be too sure of that.

Sora... I can't...

Don't say another word! It's not over. It's just not.

How can you say that? Even if we could go on...look where we are.

Aw, c'mon, Riku. You've been hanging out in darkness too long. You gotta try and think positive!

Sora?

Hm?

You lead.

Got it.

You know... I always figured I was better at stuff than you.

Really?

Are you mad?

No. I kinda always thought you were better at everything, too.

Riku---look. What's that light?

End of the road?

Yep.

Put me down. I can walk.

You know...maybe the darkness has gotten to me, too.

Riku!

This world is perfect for me. If this is what the world really is...just this, then maybe I should fade back into darkness.

Riku...

If the world is made of light and darkness... We'll be the darkness.

Yeah. The other side...the realm of light is safe now. Kairi, the King, and the others are there.

That's what I mean. Hey, Sora... Could you help me? I want to get down to the water.

At least the waves sound the same.

What I said back there...about thinking I was better at stuff than you... To tell you the truth, Sora... I was jealous of you.

What for?

I wished I could live life the way you do. Just following my heart.

Yeah, well, I've got my share of problems, too.

Like what?

Like...wanting to be like you.

Well, there is one advantage to being me... Something you could never imitate.

Really? What's that?

Having you for a friend.

Then I guess...I'm okay the way I am. I've got something you could never imitate too.

Sora? I think it's for you.

Thinking of you, wherever you are.

We pray for our sorrows to end, and hope that our hearts will blend. Now I will step forward to realize this wish.

And who knows Starting a new journey may not be so hard or maybe it has already begun. There are many worlds, but they share the same sky---one sky, one destiny.

Light.

The door to light...

We'll go together.

Yeah.

Sora! Riku!

W-We're back.

You're home.

Nothing's changed, huh?

Nope. Nothing will.

What a small world.

But part of one that's much bigger.

Yeah.

Hey Riku...what do you it was---the door to the light?

This.

This?

Yeah. It's always closer than you think.

Sora! Riku!

Hey, what's up?

Look.

From the King?

I've been having these weird thoughts lately... Like, is any of this for real or not?

So much to do, so little time... Take your time. Don't be afraid. The door is still shut. Now, step forward. Can you do it?

Power sleeps within you...

If you give it form...

It will give you strength.

Choose well.

The power of the mystic. Inner strength. A staff of wonder and ruin. Is this the power you seek?

Yes.

Your path is set.

Now, what will you give up in exchange?

The power of the warrior. Invincible courage. A sword of terrible destruction. You give up this power?

Yes.

You've chosen the power of the mystic. You've given up the power of the warrior. Is this the form you choose?

Yes.

You gained the power to fight.

All right! You've got it. Use this power to protect yourself and others.

There will be times you have to fight. Keep your light burning strong.

Behind you!

I can't open it...

Hold on. The door won't open just yet. First, tell me more about yourself.

What's most important to you?

Friendship.

Is friendship such a big deal?

What do you want outta life?

To be strong.

To be strong, huh?

What are you so afraid of?

Being indecisive.

Being indecisive? Is that really so frightening?

You want friendship. You want to be strong. You're afraid of being indecisive. Your adventure begins in the dead of night. Your road won't be easy, but a rising sun awaits your journey's end.

Sounds good.

The day you will open the door is both far off and very near.

The closer you get to the light, the greater your shadow becomes.

But don't be afraid. And don't forget...

---But don't be afraid.

You hold the mightiest weapon of all.

So don't forget...

You are the one who will open the door.

Whoa!

Gimme a break, Kairi.

Sora, you lazy bum. I knew that I'd find you snoozing down here.

No! This huge, black THING swallowed me up! I couldn't breathe! I couldn't--

Ow!

Are you still dreaming?

It wasn't a dream! Or was it? I don't know.

What was that place? So bizarre...

Yeah, sure.

Say, Kairi, what was your hometown like? You know, where you grew up.

I've told you before, I don't remember.

Nothing at all?

Nothing.

You ever want to go back?

Hmm. Well, I'm happy here.

Really...

But you know... I wouldn't mind going to see it.

I'd like to see it too. Along with any other worlds out there. I wanna see 'em all!

So what're we waiting for?

Hey!

Aren't you guys forgetting about me? So, I guess I'm the only one working on the raft.

And you're just as lazy as he is!

So you noticed. Okay, we'll finish it together.

I'll race you!

Huh?

What, are you kidding?

Ready? Go!

So, can you gather the rest of the supplies? Sora, are you listening to me?

Yeah, I heard you.

Okay, here's what you need to go find: Two Logs, One Cloth, One Rope. Bring everything back here. If you need help, just ask. I'm counting on you!

Hey, what's happening man?

Ah, the breeze feels great!

Aww, I can’t believe I lost!

Hey, Sora! You feelin' lucky today!

Man, I’m really off today.

Aww, man. Now the score’s 0 to 1!

Thanks, Sora! I found something today, too. Here, it's yours.

Tired? Want to call it a day?

Yeah, let's go home.

Okay. It is getting late. We'll finish up tomorrow.

So, Kairi's home is out there somewhere, right?

Could be. We'll never know by staying here.

But how far could a raft take us?

Who knows? If we have to, we'll think of something else.

So, suppose you get to another world. (giggle) What would you do there?

Well, I haven't really thought about it.

It's just... I've always wondered why we're here on this island. If there are any other worlds out there, why did we end up on this one? And suppose there are other worlds... Then ours is just a little piece of something much greater. So we could've just as easily ended up somewhere else, right?

I don't know.

Exactly. That's why we need to go out there and find out. Just sitting here won't change a thing. It's the same old stuff. So let's go.

You've been thinking a lot lately, haven't you?

Thanks to you. If you hadn't come here, I probably would've never thought of any of this. Kairi, thanks.

You're welcome.

Sora.

You wanted one, didn't you?

A paopu fruit...

If two people share one, their destinies become intertwined. They'll remain a part of each other's lives no matter what.

C'mon, I know you want to try it.

What are you talking--

Good morning, Your Majesty.

It's nice to see you this morn--

What!

Wake up, Goofy, wake up! This is serious!!

Hey there, Donald. G'morning.

We've got a problem, Goofy! But don't tell anyone...

Queen Minnie?

Not even the queen.

Daisy?

No, it's top secret!

G'morning, ladies.

What?

Hey, Sora. Our raft still needs a name. Let's see... How about Highwind? What would you call it?

Me? Well...hm... Excalibur!

Hey, how about...

The usual?

Let's do it!

You guys at it again? All right, I'll be the judge. The usual rules apply. Take any route you want... First one to tag that tree and make it back here wins.

If I win, I'm captain! And if you win...

I get to share the paopu with Kairi.

Huh?

Deal? The winner gets to share a paopu with Kairi.

Wha... Wait a minute...

Okay! On my count:

Three! Two! One! Go!

Now the score’s 1 to 1!

Man, lighten up. It’s just a name, after all.

Today we collect provisions for our trip! Let’s see. Sora, you’re looking for... One Seagull Egg, Three Mushrooms, Two Coconuts, Three Fish, and fill this up with Drinking Water. But not from the ocean!

Bring everything back here. If you need help, just ask.

Hey, Sora. Have you heard about the legendary power of the paopu fruit? They say if you share it with someone you really care for, it binds you together forever and ever through eternity! It's so romantic. I gotta try it sometime.

I think you've gotten stronger, but odds are you're still no match for Riku. We took him on three-to-one last time, and he whipped us all. Well, I guess Kairi can always count on him.

Me and Tidus, we are gonna do a little explorin' today. You know, to the secret place at the base of that tree. There's gotta be something there, ya?

Wh-who’s there?

I’ve come to see the door to this world.

Huh?

This world has been connected.

Wh-What are you talking about?

Tied to the darkness... Soon to be completely eclipsed.

Well, whoever you are, stop freaking me out like this. Huh?

Wh-Where did you come from?

You do not yet know what lies beyond the door.

So, you’re from another world!

There is so very much to learn. You understand so little.

Oh, yeah? Well, you’ll see. I’m gonna get out and learn what’s out there!

A meaningless effort. One who knows nothing can understand nothing.

This? I’m making a necklace of thalassa shells. In the old days, sailors always wore thalassa shells. They were supposed to ensure a safe voyage. See this?

It’s a charm to help us find each other if we ever get separated. The three of us will always be together.

Thanks, Sora! I found something today, too. Here, it’s yours.

Tired? Want to call it a day?

Yeah, let’s go home.

Okay, tomorrow’s the big day. We should rest up!

You know, Riku has changed.

What do you mean?

Well...

You okay?

Sora, let’s take the raft and go—just the two of us!

Huh?

Just kidding.

What’s gotten into you? You’re the one that’s changed, Kairi.

Maybe... You know, I was a little afraid at first, but now I’m ready. No matter where I go or what I see, I know I can always come back here.

Right?

Yeah, of course!

That’s good.

Sora, don’t ever change.

Huh?

I just can’t wait. Once we set sail, it’ll be great.

Oh, dear! What could this mean?

It means we’ll just have to trust the king.

Gawrsh, I sure hope he’s all right.

Your Highness. Don’t worry. We’ll find the king and this


Thank you, both of you.

Daisy, can you take care of the—

Of course. You be careful, now, both of you.

Oh, and to chronicle your travels, he will accompany you.

Over here!

Cricket’s the name. Jiminy Cricket, at your service.

We hope for your safe return. Please help the king.

You’re coming, too!

Gawrsh, Jiminy, your world disappeared, too?

It was terrible. We were scattered. And as far as I can see, I’m the only one who made it to this castle.

Goofy?

Oh, right... I gotcha. Ya mean, while we’re in other worlds, we can’t let on where we’re from. We’ve gotta protect the world border.




Right. World order.

I guess we’ll need new duds when we get there.

Hello up there? Donald Duck to launch crew! Anytime you’re ready.

Blast off!!

I just can’t wait. Once we set sail, it’ll be great.

A storm?

Oh, no, the raft!

Sora, dinner’s ready. Come on down. Sora?

What’s that?

Riku’s boat. And Kairi’s!

Where’s Kairi? I thought she was with you!

The door has opened...

What?

The door has opened, Sora! Now we can go to the outside world!

What are you talking about? We’ve gotta find Kairi!

Kairi’s coming with us!

Once we step through, we might not be able to come back. We may never see our parents again. There’s no turning back. But this may be our only chance. We can’t let fear stop us! I’m not afraid of the darkness!

Riku...

Keyblade... Keyblade...

Kairi!

Sora...

Whoa!

Look, a star’s goin’ out!

Come on. Let’s hurry.

Where’s that key...

Hey, ya know, maybe we ought to go find Leon.

Uh, Donald. Ya know, I betcha that...

Aw, what do you know, you big palooka?

What do I know? Hmm...

Come on, Pluto.

What a dream...

This isn’t a dream!

Where am I?

Oh, boy.

Do you know where we are?

Hey...

This is totally weird... I’m in another world!

Hey there, how can I... Aw, it’s only a kid.

I’m not a kid! And the name’s Sora!

Okay, okay, simmer down. So why the long face, Sora? You lost or somethin’?

No! Well, maybe. Where are we?

Huh?

Traverse Town... So, gramps, is this really another world?

Don’t call me gramps! The name’s Cid!

Anyway... Not sure what you’re talkin’ about, but this sure ain’t your island.

Hmm... Guess I’d better start looking for Riku and Kairi.

Well, good luck with whatever it is you’re doing. If you ever run into trouble, you come to me.

It’s those creatures from the island!

Doesn’t look like he’s here.

Keep looking!

Hmph. Where is he?

Leeeooon!

Not here, either.

This could take a while...

Leeeon! Mister Leon?

Where are you?

Still haven’t found ‘em? Keep your chin up. Take another look around town.

They’ll come at you out of nowhere.

Who are you?

And they’ll keep on coming at you, as long as you continue to wield the Keyblade.

But why? Why would it choose a kid like you?

What’s that supposed to mean?

Never mind. Now, let’s see that Keyblade.

What? There’s no way you’re getting this!

All right, then have it your way.

Hey, you found it. Nice going, Leon.

Still... It looks like things are worse than we thought. A lot worse.

Where...am I?

Sora! Kairi!

Gawrsh, there’s nobody here. Sure is spooky!

Aw, phooey. I’m not scared.

Excuse me. Did the king send you?

Come on, lazy bum. Wake up.

You okay?

I guess...

Those creatures that attacked you are after the Keyblade. But it’s your heart they really want, because you wield the Keyblade.

I’m so glad that you’re okay, Kairi.

Kairi? Who are you talking about?

I’m the great ninja Yuffie.

Huh?

I think you might’ve overdone it, Squall.

That’s Leon.

The Keyblade...

Yeah, we had to get it away from you to shake off those creatures. It turns out that’s how they were tracking you.

It was the only way to conceal your heart from them. But it won’t work for long.

Still hard to believe that you of all people are the chosen one.

Well, I suppose beggars can’t be choosers.

Why don’t you start making sense! What’s going on here?

Okay, you know there are many other worlds out there besides your castle and this town, right?

Yeah.

But they’re supposed to be a secret.

They’ve been secret because they’ve never been connected. Until now.

When the Heartless came, everything changed.

The Heartless?

The ones who attacked you, you remember?

Those without hearts.

The darkness in people’s hearts—that’s what attracts them.

And there is darkness within every heart.

Hey, have you heard of someone named Ansem?

Ansem?

He was studying the Heartless. He recorded all of his findings in a very detailed report.

Gawrsh, uh, can we see it?

It’s pages are scattered everywhere.

Scattered?

To many worlds.

Oh, then maybe the king went to find ‘em.

Yes, those were my thoughts exactly.

We’ve gotta find him quick!

Wait!

First, we need that
!

That’s right. The Keyblade.

So...this is the key?

Exactly!

The Heartless have great fear of the Keyblade.

That’s why they’ll keep coming after you no matter what.

Well, I didn’t ask for this.

The Keyblade chooses its master. And it chose you.

So tough luck.

How did all this happen? I remember being in my room...

Wait a minute! What happened to my home? My island? Riku! Kairi!

You know what? I really don’t know.

Hey, cheer up! I’ve heard that the Keyblade can open all sorts of locks. Give it a try the next time you find a treasure chest or door lock!

Sooner or later, the Heartless will find you. You’d best prepare yourself.

Prepare myself?

To fight for your life. Are you ready?

I’m ready!

Yuffie, let’s go join Aerith. She should be there now with the other visitors.

Leon!

Yuffie, go!

Yuffie?

Sora, let’s go!

Don’t bother with the small fry. Find the leader! Let’s go!

Gawrsh, are these the Heartless guys?

Let’s go get ‘em, Goofy!

The key!

So, you were looking for me?

Uh-huh!

They, too, have been seeking the wielder of the Keyblade.

Hey, why don’t you come with us? We can go to other worlds on our vessel.

I wonder if I could find Riku and Kairi...

Of course.

Are you sure?

Who knows? But we need him to come with us to help us find the king.

Sora, go with them. Especially if you want to find your friends.

Yeah, I guess.

But you can’t come along looking like that. Understand?

No frowning. No sad face. Okay?

Yeah, ya gotta look funny, like us!

This boat runs on happy faces.

Happy?

That’s one funny face!

Okay, why not? I’ll go with you guys.

Donald Duck.

Name’s Goofy.

I’m Sora.

All for one, one for all.

That little squirt took down that Heartless! Who’d have thought it?

Such is the power of the Keyblade. The child’s strength is not his own.

Why don’t we turn him into a Heartless?

That’ll settle things quick enough.

And the brat’s friends are the king’s lackeys. Swoggle me eyes, they’re all bilge rats by the look of them.

You’re no prize yourself.

Shut up!

Enough.

The Keyblade has chosen him. Will it be he who conquers the darkness? Or will the darkness swallow him? Either way, he could be quite useful.

Make sure you’re prepared for the journey ahead of you. We don’t know how far the Heartless have spread.

Check out the shops here. They’ve got some pretty neat stuff!

This is from all of us.

Spend it as you see fit. And this is from Leon.

Good luck!

I hope you find your friends.

Look out for each other. Keep your spirits up.

The gummi ship is outside that gate.

The what?

That’s our ship.

Wait ‘til you see it!

Hold on. Sora, this is for you.

Now you can use magic, too. Goofy, give him that other thing.

What?

You know!

Oh, yeah.

Abilities allow you to do all sorts of things. Guess we should look for ‘em along the way, huh?

Okay, is that it? Let’s get going!

Not ‘til we’re ready!

Well, I see big adventures coming their way! Looks like it’s up to me to keep track of it all in my journal!

There are Dalmatians named Pongo and Perdita living in the Second District...

What’s wrong?

They’re quite upset, these Dalmatians. They’ve lost their puppies.

Squall can’t stop worrying about them.

Call me Leon.

Sora, would you look for the puppies?

Help them out.

Please, find the puppies for him.

Squa--I mean, Leon--is really cute sometimes.

We travel to different worlds on the gummi ship.

The Heartless ships often give us a hard time.

Always be on the lookout during flight.

Your journey will be documented until you reach your destination.

Seek out the missions each world has to offer!

Oh, my fur and whiskers! I’m late, I’m late, I’m late!

Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! I’m here, I should be there.

I’m late, I’m late, I’m late! The queen, she’ll have my head for sure!

How did he get so small?

No, you’re simply too big.

It talks!

Must you be so loud? You woke me up.

Good morning.

Good night! I need a bit more sleep.

Wait, what do we have to do to grow small?

Why don’t you try the bottle...over there?

Court is now in session!

I’m on trial? But why?

Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts, presiding!

This girl is the culprit. There’s no doubt about it. And the reason is...because, I say so, that’s why!

That is so unfair!

Well, have you anything to say in your defense?

Of course! I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong!

You may be queen, but I’m afraid that doesn’t give you the right to be so...so mean!

Silence! You dare defy me?

Hey, guys, we should help her out.

Yeah, but the--

We’re outsiders, so wouldn’t that be muddling?


!

Oh, yeah. A-hyuck! And that’s against the rules.

The court finds the defendant...

Guilty as charged!

For the crimes of assault and attempted theft of my heart...

Off with her head!

No! No! Oh, please!

Hold it right there!

Who are you? How dare you interfere with my court?

Excuse me. But we know who the real culprit is!

Uh-huh. It’s the Heartle—

Anyway, she’s not the one you’re looking for.

That’s nonsense. Have you any proof?

Bring me evidence of Alice’s innocence! Fail, and it’s off with all of your heads! Gather as much or little evidence as you please. Report back here once you’re ready.

Who are you?

I’m Sora.

I’m Goofy, and that there’s Donald.

Pleased to meet you, though I do wish it were under better circumstances. I’m sorry you got mixed up in this nonsense.

Why are you on trial in the first place?

I should like to know the very same thing! Apparently I was guilty from the moment I took the stand!

That’s crazy! So, where are you from?

Hmm, curious. I can’t quite remember. You see, I found this mysterious rabbit hole. When I tried to peek inside, I tumbled in head over heels... And I found myself here.

So you’re from another world!

That’s funny. Maybe you don’t need a ship, then.

I don’t get it.

What do you mean
?

Enough! The defendant will be silent!

Who are you?

Who, indeed? Poor Alice. Soon to lose her head, and she’s not guilty of a thing!

Hey, if you know who the culprit is, tell us!

The Cheshire Cat has all the answers—but doesn’t always tell. The answer, the culprit, the cat all lie in darkness.

Wait!

They’ve already left the forest. I won’t tell which exit. There are four pieces of evidence in all. Three are a cinch to find. The fourth is tricky. Big reward if you find them all.

Should we trust him?

To trust, or not to trust? I trust you’ll decide!

Well, look what you’ve found. Nice going.

Now we can save Alice.

Don’t be so sure! She may be innocent, but what about you?

What do you mean?

I won’t tell. But I’ll give you something.

Are you ready to present evidence before the queen?

Yes.

Very well. Counsel, step up to the podium.

Now, show me what you have found.

Well, that’s certainly a lot of evidence, but I’m still not impressed. Cards! Bring forth my evidence!

Hmm, checking all five would only be a waste of time. All right, then. Choose the one you wish to present. I’ll decide who’s guilty based on that evidence.

What? After all the trouble of collecting it?

You dare object? Then you will lose your head! Now, choose! One box!

Are you certain? No second chances!

I’m sure.

Now we shall see who the real culprit is.

What in the world was that?

There’s your evidence. Alice is innocent.

Rrrrrrrgh... Silence! I’m the law here!

Article 29: Anyone who defies the queen is guilty!

That’s crazy!

Seize them at once!

Cards! If they touch the tower, you lose your heads!

Get them, you fools! Quit joking around!

Why, you!

She must’ve gotten kidnapped while we were fighting.

You fools!

Find the one who’s behind this! I don’t care how!

I just looked away for a moment, and...

Have you seen Alice?

Alice, no. Shadows, yes!

Where did they go?

This way? That way? Does it matter? Left, right, up, down! All mixed up thanks to the shadows! Step deeper into the forest to the deserted garden. You might find shadows in the upside-down room!

Give me a potion and I’ll make you bigger.

They’re hiding somewhere. And the momeraths outgrabe. Want to find the shadows? Try turning on the light.

It’s too dim. Make it brighter.

What next?

One more lamp that you need to light.

All the lights are on. You’ll see the shadows soon. They’ll arise in this room, but somewhere else. The shadows might go after that doorknob, too.

You’ll have a better view from higher up.

The shadows should be here soon.

Are you prepared for the worst? If not, too bad!

What a racket. How’s a doorknob to get any sleep?

What was that?

You hear that? Sounded like something closed.

This gummi ain’t like the others. No, sir.

Okay, I’ll hold on to it.

Splendid. You’re quite the hero. If you’re looking for Alice, she’s not here. She’s gone! Off with the shadows, into darkness.

No...

Let’s go back to our gummi ship. We might find her in another world.

We've gotta go to a save point to return to our ship.

Um...

Good timing. Give me a hand, will ya? Move that pedestal over there for me.

I gotta spruce this place up for the games.

It weighs a ton!

It’s way too heavy!

What? Too heavy? Since when have you been such a little—

Oh. Wrong guy. What’re you doing here?

This here’s the world-famous Coliseum—heroes only! And I got my hands full preparing for the games. So run along, pip-squeaks.

Look, it’s like this.

Heroes are coming from all over to fight ferocious monsters right here in the Coliseum.

You’ve got heroes standing right in front of you.

Yup. He’s a real hero chosen by the Keyblade!

And we’re heroes, too.

Hero? That runt?

What’s so funny? I’ve fought a bunch of monsters!

Hey, if you can’t even move this...

You can’t call yourself...

A hero!

Okay, so it takes more than brawn.

Well, well, let’s see what you can do. This trial is tough. You got what it takes? You ready?

I’m ready!

Okay, kid. Let’s see what you’ve got.

The rules are simple: Bust all the barrels within the time limit. Ready? Go!

Not bad! For a beginner, that is.

Hey, you’re better than I thought!

You know, you ain’t bad, kid.

Looks like I’m headed for the games.

Afraid not.

Why not?

Two words: You guys ain’t heroes.

Come on!

Wanna become a real hero? Start by mastering this spell.

Rather a stubborn old goat, wouldn’t you say?

Who are you?

Whoa, hold on there, fuzz boy. Wait, let me guess. You want to enter the games, right?

Well, then, hey, get a load of this.

A pass?

It’s all yours.

Good luck, kid. I’m pulling for you, little shorty.

Hey, how’d you get this?

Can we enter the games now?

Well... I guess so. We start with the preliminaries! Some real weirdos signed up for the games. Better watch yourself.

You’re no heroes yet, but you ain’t doing bad. Lucky you came to me for coaching.

Something tells me he’ll be a tough one to beat. Who knows, maybe you’ll end up facing him.

Say, you’re better than I thought, kid! Wish he was here to see this.

Who?

Hercules. He’s a hero if ever there was one. Too bad he’s off visiting his father.

That little punk is your next opponent, okay?

Now, don’t blow it. Just take him out.

The great god of the Underworld is afraid of a kid? Sorry, but my contract says—

I know! You think I don’t know? I wrote the contract! I know it says you’re only required to kill Hercules in this tournament. But you’ve gotta fight that kid to get to him. Come on.

Hey, it’s like that old goat says: Rule 11: It’s all just a game, so let loose and have fun with it!

I mean, a casualty along the way is no big deal, right?

Geez. Stiffer than the stiffs back home. Still, suckers like him are hard to come by...

That’s the best you can do?

Oh, right, there was one other rule I forgot: Accidents happen.

Herc!

Phil, get them out of here!

Whew, that was close! That was Cerberus, the guardian of the Underworld. Herc should be able to handle him. But then again, maybe not... This doesn’t look good. I hope Herc’s okay. Wish I could go in!

Kid, you’re not entering the arena, are ya? This ain’t just some match. This is for real!

I’m not afraid. You can decide if I’m hero material or not.

Careful, kid!

Kid, I got two words of advice for you: Attack!

Thus, I do hereby dub thee junior heroes, and confer upon thee full rights and privileges to participate in the games. Further—

Hey! What do you mean
?

You rookies still don’t understand what it takes to be a true hero.

So, what does it take?

Well, that’s just something you’ll have to find out for yourselves. Just the way that I did.

No problem. We’ll start by proving ourselves in the games.

There ain’t gonna be any games for a while.

Gotta clean up the mess from that last battle first.

Okay, we’ll be back.

I still can’t believe that squirt actually beat Cerberus.

Just between us, I’d already worn Cerberus down by the time the little guy jumped in.

My lips are sealed.

Hey, are you all right?

Yeah.

So why did you go along with him, anyway?

I’m looking for someone. Hades promised to help. I tried to exploit the power of darkness, but it backfired.

I fell into darkness, and I couldn’t find the light.

You’ll find it. I’m searching, too.

For your light?

Don’t lose sight of it.

How about a rematch sometime? Fair and square, no dark powers involved.

I think I’ll pass.

He’s strong, he’s kind.

He’s always there for you, and he’s handsome to boot.

He’s perfect. Perfect. Perfectly infuriating! He makes me crazy.

Wait a minute. What are you worried about? All the pieces are in place. Relax. Here’s what you do. Let Hercules train the kid. In the next games, I’ll take care of them both.

Who invited you to the party? Stay out of this. This is my show.

As you wish. Fight to your heart’s content.

Hey, Donald, maybe King Mickey’s down there.

In a backwater place like that? No way! Let’s move on.

Hold on. Riku and Kairi might be down there. Let’s just check it out.

Forget it! We’re on an important mission!

Just land!

No!

Come on!

Aw, phooey!

We’re landing!

Don’t touch that! Nooo!

Oww...my head...

Donald? Goofy?

Sabor, danger.

Um...thank you.

Thank you.

Huh? Uh, what is this place?

This place, this place.

Okaaay... Where did the others go?

Look, I got separated from my friends. Have you seen them?

Friends...

Friends!

Right, my friends! There’s two of ‘em. The loud one is Dona—

You know what? Never mind. I’m looking for my friends, Riku and Kairi.

Look for Riku, friends?

Right!

Kairi, friends?

Uhh...right...

Friends here.

Really!?

Huh?

Friends here.

Not sure I understand, but show me! Take me to Riku and Kairi!

Tarzan. Tarzan go.

And I’m...Sora. Tarzan go, Sora go go!

Gawrsh, where are we?

I sure hope Sora’s okay.

Aw, who needs him? We can find the king without him.

Huh?

Jane!

Tarzan!

Oh, and who is this?

Uh, hi there. I’m—

Oh, you speak English! So, then, obviously, you’re not related to Tarzan...

Are you here to study the gorillas?

Highly doubtful.

Sora!

Goofy! Donald!

A circus of clowns. Not much use for hunting gorillas.

Mr. Clayton, we’re studying them, not hunting them. This is research.

Well, the more the merrier. Do make yourselves at home.

Well, anyway...

I’m staying.

Huh?

Sora, look what we found. Look at this.

What’s that?

A gummi block. It’s the same stuff used to build our ship.

So that means...

The king could be here. So, we’ve gotta work together to look for him. For now.

Fine. I’ll let you tag along. For now.

Apparently Tarzan was raised in the jungle by the gorillas. Communicating with him still isn’t easy, but he’s learning.

So he was speaking in
back there...

Ah, that’s right. You’re looking for your friends?

He said Riku and Kairi are here. And one word I couldn’t understand...

Why don’t we try this? We’ll show Tarzan some slides and see if any of them match that word. Oh, what happened to the slides?

Clayton’s the name. I’m a hunter, not a researcher. What? No, I am not trying to hunt the gorillas. But they’re so rare! I’d just like to get a look at them.

What’s wrong, Sora?

What? Um...nothing. (thinking) This place... It just looks so familiar. But how? I’ve never been off my island.

Well, Tarzan?

Where are my friends, Riku and Kairi?

Hey, I thought—

That leaves just one place.

Young man, we’ve been in this jungle for some time now. But we have yet to encounter these friends of yours. I’d wager they’re with the gorillas. But Tarzan refuses to take us to them.

Really, Mr. Clayton. Tarzan wouldn’t hide—

Then take us there! Take us to the gorillas.

Go-ril-las.

Tarzan...are you sure?

Tarzan go see Kerchak.

Kerchak?

He must be the leader. Perfect. I’ll go along as an escort. After all, the jungle is a dangerous place.

Kerchak, please listen to me. I know the nesting ground is secret, but I trust them. You see, I want to help them because...because... well, they need us.

Uh... Did you get that?

No.

Kerchak.

Kerchak...

He seemed sorta distracted by something.

Was he looking toward the tree house?

What’s the big idea?

Wait, Kerchak. Please!

You don’t understand. I was only trying to... Ah. A snake slithered by, you see. I saved that poor gorilla’s life.

How could you do such a thing!

Now, Miss Porter, as I told you, I was not aiming at the gorilla.

You are not to go near the gorillas again!

All because of one mishap? Come, now...

What am I doing with these imbeciles?

Blasted gorillas! I’ll hunt down every last one of them! I’ll track them down somehow.

I’ll stake my life on it.

Heartless!

Don’t mind Mr. Clayton. He’s not a bad person—just a bit impetuous.

I do hope Mr. Clayton is safe...

Hey, where’s Jane?

What’s wrong, Tarzan?

Something coming. Jane, danger. Jane near... Near tree house.

Sounds like trouble. Let’s go.

Tarzan!

Clayton came to the tent, and... That’s the last thing I remember.

Clayton?

Gorillas trapped. Terk ran.

We must help the gorillas!

No!

Clayton?

Not Clayton!

Not Clayton!

Lazy beast!

Tarzan, home.

This is your home? But that means...

Huh?

The waterfalls... They’re echoing all the way here.

Friends there. See friends.

Oh, now I’ve got it. (recites Mangani word) means heart. Friends in our hearts...

Heart...

Oh, so that’s what it meant.

Friends, same heart. Clayton, lose heart. No heart, no see friends. No heart, no friends.

Sorry about what I said.

I’m sorry too.

Yeah. All for one, huh?

A gummi!

But it’s sure not thing king’s.

I think someone has a new admirer.

No, no, no, no! Daisy would kill me!

What drew the Heartless to that world?

The hunter lured them there. It was his lust for power that was the bait. But it seems the bait was too tasty for his own good.

Yeah, he got chomped instead!

A weak-hearted fool like him stood no chance against the Heartless. But the boy is a problem. He found one of the Keyholes.

Fear not. It will take him ages to find the rest.

Besides, he remains blissfully unaware of our other plan.

Yes, the princesses...

They are falling into our hands, one by one. Speaking of which...

Well, guess we’d better get going.

Where is your ship, anyway?

Well, uh... Not too far.

Sora, Tarzan, friends

The gummi block that came out of that glowing hole... It’s not like the others. Wonder what it’s used for.

I dunno.

Maybe Leon’ll know.

Hmm... He might. Back to Traverse Town, then?

I wanna be pilot!

Hey, stop it!

Oh, come on! I’m the Keyblade master.

I don’t care who you are! No!

Here we go again...

Leon’s probably at the underground cavern. He trains there often. You know, the channel in the alleyway is connected to the cavern.

So, you found the Keyhole.

Yeah. The Keyblade locked it automatically.

Good.

Every world among the stars has a Keyhole. And each one leads to the heart of that world. There must be one in this town as well.

What do you mean?

It was in Ansem’s report.

The Heartless enter through the Keyhole and do something to the world’s core.

What happens to the world?

In the end, it disappears.

What!

That’s why your key is so important.

Please lock the Keyholes. You’re the only one who can.

I don’t know...

Seeing other worlds would probably serve you well.

Yeah!

We gotta find your friends! And King Mickey!

I guess you’re right... Okay!

Hey, Leon. This gummi block’s different from the others. Do you know what it’s for?

Ask Cid. He should know.

Wait, Sora. Take this with you.

This stone holds some mysterious power. I’ve been carrying it for luck. I want you to hold onto it.

How do you use it?

Uh, Leon?

A big tournament is being held somewhere, kupo.

What’ve you got there? Hey! Well, if it ain’t a gummi block.

Yup.

What’s this one for?

You’re kiddin’ me! You’re flyin’ a gummi ship and you don’t know nothin’ about navigation gummis? Bunch of pinheads. Interspace ain’t no playground.

There’s a lot we don’t know. So what! We have to use the gummi ship to go to other worlds. We don’t have a choice.

Whoa, easy.

I didn’t know. No hard feelings, all right? Well, I guess I could lend y’all a hand, then.

Thanks.

Basically, with navigation gummis, you can go to new places. You want one on your ship, right?

I’ll install it for you. But I got this thing I gotta go deliver first.

What do you need to deliver?

Just this book. It’s real old. When the guy brought it in, it was practically falling apart. Too beat up to restore it to the way it was. But overall, I did a decent job puttin’ it back together. Anyway, you mind deliverin’ it for me? It’s the old house past the Third District. Look for a big fire sign.

Wh-What was that?

Hmm? The bell at the gizmo shop is ringing. Go check it out if you want, but deliver that book for me first. When you’re done, stop by the house in the Third District. I’ll be there.

There’s something about this musty place...

It reminds me of the secret place back home, where we used to scribble on the walls. Remember?

Kairi?

Sora?

Well, well.

You’ve arrived sooner than I expected.

Wha... You knew we were coming?

Of course.

Are you...a Heartless?

He doesn’t look like one.

Oh, my. No. My name is Merlin. As you can see, I am a sorcerer. I spend much of my time traveling. It’s good to be home. Your king has requested my help.

King Mickey?

Yes, indeed. Donald, Goofy. And who might you be, young man?

I’m Sora.

Ah. So, you have found the key.

What did the king ask you to do?

Just a moment...

Presto!

There, now. Ahem.

Your king asked me to train you in the art of magic. We can start anytime you like. Let me know when you’re ready to begin the training. Oh, and one more thing.

Hello. I’m the Fairy Godmother. Your king asked me to help, too. I will assist throughout your journey.

I do not know how much I can be of help, but do stop by anytime.

Oh, that book... So, Cid asked you to bring this. Thank you. You wish to know what kind of book it is? I don’t even know, myself. In fact, it’s not mine. Somehow it found its way into my bag one day. It was such a curious book, I asked Cid to repair it for me. Well, I guess I’ll put it here somewhere, for now. This book holds a great secret. The missing pages will unlock it.

I’ll leave the book over there. Do look at it whenever you like. My best regards to Cid for repairing it for me. Oh, and about that stone of yours... You should ask the Fairy Godmother about that.

Do you know what this is?

Oh, the poor thing! He has turned into a summon gem.

A summon gem?

This little creature lived in a world that was consumed by darkness. When a world vanishes, so do its inhabitants. But this one has such a strong heart, he became a gem instead of vanishing with his world.

Can he regain himself?

Yes, but only his spirit. Now, watch!

Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

Whenever you call, he will help you. If you find any more of these, bring them to me. Don’t worry, when their worlds are restored they will return there. Sora, please help save them.

Don’t worry, I will.

Think, think. Think, think.

Hi there. What’s wrong?

Nothing. Just thinking.

Oh.

I was thinking of how to say goodbye to Pooh.

Pooh?

Yes?

Wait a second. You’re Pooh?

Yes, I’m Winnie the Pooh. Pooh for short. Who are you?

I’m Sora.

Oh. Hello, Sora. Have you come to say goodbye to Pooh, too?

Well, no. Why would I do that? We’ve only just met.

Because everyone’s gone away.

What do you mean?

Well, we all lived here in the Hundred Acre Wood. And we’d take walks together, or play Pooh sticks... And every day, I’d eat some honey. Just one small smackeral would taste very good right now.

But now everyone’s gone. All my friends, and my favorite Hunny Tree too. Everyone must’ve gone away while I was napping, I think... So, who knows?

Maybe I shall end up going away somewhere as well. But I wonder, how do I say goodbye to myself?

Think, think, think.

Oh, my tumbly is getting rather rumbly.

Oh, bother. There’s no more honey left. If only the Hunny Tree would visit... Then I could eat my fill.

Let me guess: You’d like to know what happens next. Unfortunately, some of the pages are missing, so I can’t tell you yet. The pages are scattered over many worlds. Would you find them for us?

You’d best go see Cid before going anywhere else.

There you are. What’s going on?

Riku!

Hey, hey, cut it out.

I’m not dreaming this time, right?

I hope not. Took forever to find you.

Riku!

Wait a second, where’s Kairi?

Isn’t she with you?

Well, don’t worry. I’m sure she made it off the island, too.

We’re finally free. Hey, she might even be looking for us now.

We’ll all be together again soon. Don’t worry. Just leave everything to me. I know this—

Leave it to who?

Sora, what did you—

I’ve been looking for you and Kairi, too, with their help.

Who are they?

Ahem. My name is—

We’ve visited so many places and worlds, looking for you.

Really? Well, what do you know? I never would have guessed.

Oh, and guess what? Sora’s the Keyblade master.

Who would’ve thought it?

What’s that mean?

So, this is called a Keyblade?

Huh?

Hey, give it back.

Catch!

Whoa!

Okay, so you’re coming with us, right? We’ve got this awesome rocket. Wait ‘til you see it!

No, he can’t come!

What?

Forget it!

Oh, come on! He’s my friend!

I don’t care!

Huh? He’s gone.

Riku?

Nice going. Oh, well. At least, he’s okay.

And who knows? Maybe we’ll run into Kairi soon, too.

You guys ever hear of Maleficent?

I hear she’s in town.

Who is she?

A witch, man, she’s a witch!

She’s the reason this town is full of Heartless. Don’t take her lightly.

She’s been using the Heartless for years.

We lost our world, thanks to her.

One day, a swarm of Heartless took over our world!

That was nine years ago.

I got out of that mess and came here with these guys.

That’s awful!

Our ruler was a wise man named Ansem. He dedicated his life to studying the Heartless.

His report should tell us how to get rid of the Heartless.

Where’s this report?

We don’t know. It got scattered when our world was destroyed.

I’m sure Maleficent’s got most of the pages.

You see? It’s just as I told you. While you toiled away trying to find your dear friend, he quite simply replaced you with some new companions. Evidently, now he values them far more than he does you.

You’re better off without that wretched boy.

Now, think no more of him and come with me. I’ll help you find what you’re searching for...

So, you delivered that book? That navigation gummi’s installed and ready to go. You find another one, you bring it to me. I threw in a warp gummi for the heck of it. Now you can jump to worlds you’ve been to before. Well, better get back to my real job. What’s my real job? You’ll see. See me at the First District.

I’ve been thinking about the bell in the Second District.

That one that rang a bit ago?

The one above the gizmo shop. There’s a legend about it, you know.

But it’s all boarded up. Nobody can get in there.

Heck, go check it out. Ring it three times to see if anything happens.

Hey, now that was quick! Now you know. I’m in the gummi block business. Workin’ on your gummi ship sure was great. Come again and I’ll give you a big discount.

Go ahead, take it. It’s a special giveaway.

Hey, got another navigation gummi there, eh? I’ll bet you want it installed.

Yeah, please.

Hmm... Looks like this is another one of those blocks that come in sets. You gotta find the mate to this one.

Well, well, as I live and breathe! If it isn’t Pinocchio!

Oh. Hi, Jiminy.

What in the world are you doing down here?

Um... Playing hide-and-seek.

I just don’t believe it. And here I was, up all night, just worried sick about you. Why of all the—

Pinocchio!

Pinocchio! Are you telling me the truth?

Yes!

Then tell me, what is this?

It was a present.

No fibbing, now! You know you’re not supposed to tell lies. A lie only grows and grows, ‘til you get caught! Plain as the nose on your face!

But if you want something, why wait? Why not just take it?

Oh, my! Who told you that? You need some advice from your conscience!

That’s right! You’re my conscience, Jiminy! I’ll never tell lies as long as you’re around.

You need to be good so you can become a real boy. You promised Geppetto you would be, right?

Oh! Do you know where Father is?

He’s not with you?

Jiminy, let’s go find Father!

Now, hold on! There are all sorts of dangers and temptations out there! I’ll go find Geppetto, so you just wait here. These fellows here will be helping me.

We will?

Well, shall we go, Sora?

You could’ve asked us first...

I never thought you’d do it. Not bad.

Phil, you’re just as stubborn as ever. Don’t pretend you’re not happy for them!

Ahem! Now, kid, you’ve still got a long way to go. The next round’s startin’ soon. Next time it’ll be the real thing.

And the Keyhole?

The Heartless are searching for it now. I’m certain we’ll find it soon enough. So that just leaves...

Jafar! I’ve looked everywhere for Jasmine. She’s disappeared like magic!

The girl is more trouble than she’s worth.

You said you had things under control.

Agrabah is full of holes for rats to hide in. But why worry about Princess Jasmine? With her or without her, surely this world will be ours when we find the Keyhole.

We need all seven princesses of heart to open the final door. Any fewer is useless.

Well, if the princess is that important, we’ll find her.

Find Jasmine and bring her to me at once.

Don’t steep yourself in darkness too long. The Heartless consume the careless.

Your concern is touching, but hardly necessary.

Who’s there? Hello?

I’m Jasmine. My father is the sultan of Agrabah.

Uh... So that makes you a princess.

But he has been deposed by Jafar, who now controls the city.

Jafar?

You haven’t heard of him? He’s the royal vizier. He’s gained evil powers and seized Agrabah. He’s desperately looking for something— something he calls the
Jafar caught me trying to escape, but he helped me.

Who helped you?

We were hiding nearby, but he left a while ago to take care of something... Oh, I hope Aladdin’s all right.

Aladdin? Where might I find this street rat?

Jasmine, allow me to find you more suitable company, my dear princess. These little rats won’t do, you see.

Jasmine, run!

Ah, the boy who holds the key.

The carpet flew off toward the desert. Let’s follow it, Sora!

Gawrsh, not again!

Genie, get rid of these guys!

Wish Number One, coming right up!

I see... Thanks, Sora.

Aladdin, what’re you doing out here?

Same old stuff. Hunting legendary treasure. Just paid a visit to the Cave of Wonders.

I found that magic carpet, and this lamp.

Legend has it that whoever holds the lamp can summon the—

Please, kid, leave the intros to a professional. (winking) The one and only GENIE OF THE LAMP!

Rub-a-dub-dub the lamp and have your dearest wishes granted.

Today’s winner is...Aladdin! Congratulations!

Any wish?

Patience, my fine feathered friend.

Any three wishes ! A one wish (one genie disappears), a two wish (two disappear), a three wish. Then I make like a banana and split!

Our lucky winner made his first wish—

And let me tell you, what a doozy that wish was—

So he has two left.

So, master, what’ll you have for Wish Number Two?

Hmm, how about making me a fabulously wealthy prince?

Oooh! Money! Royalty! Fame!

Okay, you asked for it! A hundred servants and a hundred camels loaded with gold!

Just say the word and I’ll deliver it in 30 minutes or less, or your meal’s free.

Hey, I’ll even throw in a cappuccino!

No, thanks!

Okay.

I think I’ll put that on hold until we reach Agrabah.

Uh, why a prince?

You see, there’s this girl in Agrabah named Jasmine. But she’s a princess, and I’m... Aww, she could never fall for a guy like me.

Oh. Princess?

Jasmine?

Oh, that’s right! She’s in trouble, Aladdin!

What? Well, c’mon, let’s get going!

Ah, fresh air! The great outdoors!

I guess you don’t get out much, huh?

Comes with the job. Phenomenal cosmic powers. Itty-bitty living space. It’s always three wishes, then back to my portable prison. I’m lucky to see the light of day every century or two...

Say, Genie, what if I use my last wish to free you from the lamp? What do you think?

You’d do that?

Genie, it’s a promise. After we help Jasmine.

So, Jafar is after Jasmine and this


Keyhole, eh? I could swear I’ve heard about that somewhere before...

Really? Where?

Now, where was it? It’s only been 200 years...

Well, anyway, we’ve got to stop Jafar before it’s too late.

Setting your sights a little high, aren’t you boy? Back to your hole, street rat. I will not allow you to trouble the princess any more.

Jasmine!

I’m so sorry, Aladdin.

Genie, help Jasmine, please!

One wish left! You’re making this really easy, you know.

So sorry, boy. I’m afraid your second wish has been denied.

I’m sorry, Al.

And now, I bid you all farewell. Attack!

Courage!

Jasmine!

To the desert! Come on, let’s move!

My first wish, Genie! Show me the Keyhole!

That boy again?

He’s more persistent than I expected. Why not explain the situation to that boy Riku? Doing so may actually prove useful to our--

Wait a second. Are you Maleficent?

Jafar, let Jasmine go!

Not a chance.

You see, she’s a princess—one of seven who somehow hold the key to opening the door.

Open...

...the door?

But you fools won’t live to see what lies beyond it. Genie! My second wish. Crush them!

Genie, no!

Sorry, Al. The one with the lamp calls the shots. I don’t have a choice.

I’m really sorry about this. Run!

Genie!

My final wish! I want you to make me and all-powerful genie!

The lamp! Get Jafar’s lamp!

Iago! Keep the lamp away from them!

Yeah, yeah, I hear you!

Nag, nag! It’s all he ever does!

Ugh! Is it hot in here, or is it just me?

Water! Water!

Keep moving!

I don’t need your help, all right!

Okay, Jafar! Back to your lamp!

Jasmine? Jasmine!

Whoa, we’d better get out of here!

Jasmine!

So, Jasmine’s no longer in Agrabah. Sora, let’s go find her.

Sorry. I can’t take you with me.

Wh-Why not?

I sure wish we could...

But we can’t. If we take him to another world, we would be...

Muh... Mudd—

Meddling!

Aladdin, we’ll find Jasmine. I promise.

Uh, earth to Al. Hello? You still have one wish left. Look, just say the word. Ask me to find Jasmine for you.

I...I wish...

For your freedom, Genie.

Al!

A deal’s a deal, Genie. Now you can go anywhere you want. You’re your own master. But if you can, it’d be great if you could go along with them and help Sora find Jasmine.

Sorry, Al. I’m done taking orders from others. But... A favor, now that’s entirely different.

I guess I could give that a try.

After all, we’re pals, right, Al?

Genie...

Just leave it to me!

That smarmy vizier could’ve had ‘em—if someone had stuck around to give him a hand.

Hey, I did my part. I brought the princess, didn’t I?

Jafar was beyond help, consumed by his own hatred. One should beware of letting it burn too fiercely.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lighten up. I’m as cool as they come, okay? By the way, kid, have we got something special for you.

Huh?

We had a deal, yes? You help us, and we grant you your wish...

Kairi!

Go to her. Your vessel is waiting.

Just remember, this is no pleasure cruise. It won’t be a pleasant voyage.

Why are you doing all this for me? What’s the catch?

Catch? What’s the catch?

Silly, boy. You’re like a son to me. I only want you to be happy.

I seriously doubt that.

Believe what you wish. But lest we forget, I kept my end of the bargain.

Here. Take this with you.

Sora, please find Jasmine for me.

Could this torn page be from Merlin’s book?

Let’s return to town and give it to him.

Hello, i-is anyone there?

Wh-Wh-What am I to do? I’m all alone. (calling) Pooh? Pooh? Where are you? It’s me, Piglet.

Oh dear! I was j-just... N-Never mind. I’m sorry!

Don’t be scared. You’re looking for Pooh, right?

You know Pooh?

Oh, y-you see, I-I have something for him. I have to take it to Pooh right away!

Oh, Pooh!

Oh, I believe I smell a delicious something—a something like honey!

Pooh!

Hello, Piglet. How have you been?

Oh, I-I’m so glad to see you. I thought you’d gone away. I brought wh-what you asked for.

Thank you, Piglet. Now I can finally have some honey.

Really? B-But how?

I shall hold on to the balloon, and fly like a bee up the Hunny Tree, see.

But if you take their honey, won’t the bees be angry?

Hmm...

Oh!

If you could only chase away those bees, I’m quite certain I could get a small morsel of honey. Would you help me get some honey?

Sure!

Oh. Hello there, Owl.

Good day, Pooh. What are you doing? Using a balloon to get some honey? Splendid idea! Allow me to offer a few pointers.

Ahem! Now, Pooh can get honey by floating up this tree with his balloon. The honey is inside the tree hollows, not the beehives you see here.

There’s quite a lot of honey in these holes. If Pooh gets too close, the bees will come out to protect their honey. If they get to Pooh, they’ll pop his balloon. Lock onto the bees and swat them away. The more time Pooh has at each hollow, the more honey he can eat. There’s more honey higher up, too. If jumping from branch to branch proves difficult, try the Rush command. Rush can help you catch up to Pooh quickly. But it isn’t fully reliable. Good luck.

It is rather funny what I will do for honey.

Oh, another summon gem? Let’s help this little one. Here we go! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

If you find any more of these stones, bring them to me.

What is that?

Wow, it’s huge!

It’s a giant whale!

It’s Monstro! He’s a whale of a whale, and vicious besides!

Whoa! Sora, get us out of here!

Too late! He’s going to swallow us!

It’s true! I saw it with my own eyes!

You sure you didn’t just hear it this time?

What difference does it make? There’s a huge monster in there, I tell you!

All right. Suppose there really is a monster... Think we can beat it by ourselves, Sora?

No problem. Let’s do it!

Listen! There! Can you hear it growling?

Shh, quiet.

We’ve gotta be careful.

See that? It was just the wind making that noise.

Aw, man. I wish it was a monster! Hold on! What’s that over there?

A window, or maybe a door? It won’t open.

Geez, is that really all that’s in here?

What do you expect in a boring place like this?

Hey, Sora.

Hm?

When we grow up, let’s get off this island. We’ll go on real adventures, not this kid stuff!

Sure. But isn’t there anything fun to do now? Hey, you know the new girl at the mayor’s house? Did you hear?

Knock it off!

Hey, Sora. Are you okay?

What are you guys doing? Where are we, anyway?

Whoa!

Uh, ya know, I think that big ol’ whale Monstro just swallowed us. And for today’s weather: expect showers.

Heavy showers!

Hey! Who’s there?

It’s me.

Oh, it’s just Pinocchio. ...Pinocchio!?

Pinocchio?

Pinocch, where are you going? Pinocch! Come on, everybody! After him! Quick!

What have you got there, Pinocchio?

With this, we can get out of her, Father.

Really? With this big block? You think so?

It’s true.

So, how did you end up here, Pinocchio?

Oh, my. So the whale swallowed all of you, too? My goodness.

Yeah, looks like it.

My name is Geppetto. I’m Pinocchio’s father. When we got separated, I traveled all over, looking for him.

Thank goodness we’re together again.

So, you seem to know Pinocchio quite well. I hope he was a good boy in my absence.

Well, we’ve all had quite a journey. Right, Pinocchio?

Pinocchio? I warned him not to wander off here. He can be a naughty boy. Even so, he’s very precious to me.

What are you doing? Come on, let’s go back.

You know, Geppetto’s awfully worried about you.

Pinocchio, stop fooling around! This is no time for games!

But, Sora, I thought you liked games.

Or are you too cool to play them now that you have the Keyblade?

Riku! Wh-What are you doing here?

Just playing with Pinocchio.

You know what I mean! What about Kairi? Did you find her?

Maybe. Catch us and maybe I’ll tell you what I know.

Come on!

Why do you still care about that boy? He has all but deserted you for the Keyblade and his new companions, after all.

I don’t care about him. I was just messing with him a little.

Oh, really? Of course you were.

Beware the darkness in your heart. The Heartless prey upon it.

Mind your own business.

Riku! What’s the matter with you? What are you thinking? Don’t you realize what you’re doing?

I was about to ask you the same thing, Sora. You only seem interested in running around and showing off that Keyblade these days. Do you even want to save Kairi?

I do.

You up for this?

No problem. Let’s do it!

Get me out of here!

Help! It’s scary in here!

Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Please! Give me back my son!

Sorry, old man. I have some unfinished business with this puppet.

He’s no puppet! Pinocchio is my little boy!

He is unusual. Not many puppets have hearts. I’m not sure, but maybe he can help someone who’s lost theirs.

Wait a minute. Are you talking about Kairi?

What do you care about her?

Hey, let Pinocchio go, Riku.

A puppet that’s lost its heart to the Heartless... Maybe it holds the key to helping Kairi. How about it, Sora? Let’s join forces to save her. We can do it, together.

What? You’d rather fight me? Over a puppet that has no heart?

Heart or no heart, at least he still has a conscience.

Conscience?

You might not hear it, but right now it’s loud and clear. And it’s telling me you’re on the wrong side!

Then you leave me no choice.

Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

Jiminy... I’m not gonna make it.

Oh! I guess I’m okay!

Run!

Riku! Riku, where are you?

So, Kairi’s like a lifeless puppet now?

Precisely.

And her heart was...

Taken by the Heartless, no doubt.

Tell me! What can I do?

There are seven maidens of the purest heart. We call them the princesses of heart. Gather them together, and a door will open to the heart of all worlds. Within lies untold wisdom. There, you will surely find a way to recover Kairi’s heart. Now, I’ll grant you a marvelous gift.

The power to control the Heartless.

Soon, Kairi. Soon.

I sure hope Pinocchio and Geppetto are okay.

Yeah, hopefully they landed safely somewhere.

Riku...

Oh, another summon gem? Let’s help this little one. Here we go! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

If you find any more of these stones, bring them to me.

Nobody’s home! And I’m out of honey!

Look, Rabbt’s house c-came back! But it looks like Rabbit isn’t home. Pooh’s been calling and calling, but the house says no one’s there.

Nobody’s home?

That’s right, Nobody!

Who is this person named Nobody?

Nobody, have you seen Rabbit?

No! No Rabbit here! There’s no one here!

Hello, Rabbit!

Why, P-Pooh. What a pleasant surprise... Nice to see you, too, Piglet. And...

Is this a new friend? P-Pooh, I’m sorry, but... I’m all out of honey at the moment.

Sora, do you smell honey?

H-Honey? Now, how did that get up there? Would you like some Pooh? Don’t feel you have to, of course.

Oh, thank you, Rabbit. I would like just a small smackeral. I’m quite hungry.

Um, Pooh Bear...

You’re not eating the whole pot, are you?

Once you start, there’s no stopping you, is there...

Ohh... Out of honey again.

H-Help! Please help Pooh!

Oh, help and bother. I’m stuck again. I came in through this hole, so it must have shrunk.

Oh, wh-what to do?

All this because he can’t stop liking honey so much!

Oh, how will I eat honey if I’m stuck here? When it’s lunch time, perhaps you could bring me a honey jar.

No honey ‘til you’re unstuck!

If Pooh doesn’t slim down, my house will stay plugged up forever! If only there were something we could do...

Wait, I know! A bit of carrot top juice will do the trick! I have a carrot patch on the other side of the stream. Carrot top juice is just the ticket to slimming down a Pooh!

Oh, no!

Hey, there! Name’s Tigger! T-I-double-guh-RR. That spells Tigger!

Well, now! I don’t think I’ve ever seen you before!

Hello, Tigger. You’ve just bounced my new friend Sora.

Hey, Pooh! Say, you’re lookin’ mighty uncomfy today. Is that some new exercise? Why, bouncin’ around is a lot more fun.

Wh-Why do you bounce around so much, Tigger?

Why? ‘Cause bouncin’ is what Tiggers do best!

Speaking of which, my bouncin’ spot has gone and disappeared! So for now, this’ll be my new bouncin’ ground.

Tigger’s bouncing will ruin my vegetables! And if we don’t give Pooh some carrot top juice, he’ll be stuck forever.

Please help me! Keep Tigger away from my carrots!

This is quite a fix. But I have just the solution. Pay attention, now.

Sora, you’ll have to protect this carrot patch. If Tigger bounces on a carrot twice, it’ll be buried.

Once...

Twice!

Just like that. Protect the carrots from Tigger’s bounces and you’ll receive points. How you ask? It’s elementary!

Simply get to the carrots before Tigger lands on them. There are fifteen carrots here. Your score depends on how many you save, and how many times you block Tigger. Oh, and one more thing.

The Rush command is the key to a high score. Select Rush while near a carrot that isn’t buried yet. You’ll dash to the target area before Tigger lands. Well, good luck!

How about those bounceroonies? They were good even for a Tigger.

Thank you so much. Now I’d better make that carrot top juice. I’ll get the carrots, so please wait inside the house.

Oh, what a day! I gave Pooh the carrot top juice. All we have to do now is push him out. Just a little push should do.

First my vegetable patch and now this...

Oh, bother. Where am I? It’s ever so dark in here. Well, it isn’t so bad, I suppose. There is plenty of honey.

That was great! Looks like Phil’s trained another great hero!

Is strength the most important part of a hero?

Well, what you really need is a strong heart. What makes a strong heart? If you have to ask, you’re not a hero yet!

Stop talking in riddles!

It’s not a riddle!

Okay, guys. Prepare for landing.

Land where? In the sea? We’ll drown!

Not with my magic, we won’t. Just leave it to me.

Come on, Sebastian!

Ariel, wait! Slow down! Don’t leave me behind!

Relax, Sebastian. They don’t look like one of them. Right, Flounder?

I don’t know. There’s something weird about them.

What do you mean?

They do seem... a little different. Where are you from?

We’re from kind of far away. And we’re not really used to these waters.

Oh, I see. In that case... Sebastian can show you how we swim around here.

Ariel, King Triton will not like this!

Oh, don’t worry.

Easy for you to say... Okay, it’s time you learn how to swim properly. Practice swimming with Flounder. Try to tag him. All right. Begin.

Good job. Now let’s move onto self-defense.

Sebastian!

Class is over. Good luck!

Those creatures chased us here.

Oh, no! Those monsters might be heading for the palace, too!

We’d better head back right away!

But, wh-what if we run into more on our way back?

I’m sorry, but we need your help. Please come to the palace with us. The trident markers on the walls point the way there. We won’t get lost as long as we follow them. Okay, let’s get going.

That was too close. As long as I have my trident, I will not tolerate those creatures inside this palace.

Daddy!

Oh, Ariel! When will you listen? It’s dangerous out there!

Strange creatures lurk outside.

Behold. You swim before the ruler of the seas: His Majesty, King Triton.

And who are they?

They helped us fight off those creatures.

They don’t look familiar.

We’re from an ocean very far away.

Yup. We came to find the Keyhole.

The what?

What’s that?

A-hyuck! Well, it’s a—

There’s no such thing! Certainly not here!

But, Daddy...

Ariel, not another word! You are not to leave the palace. Is that clear?

Perhaps I’m being too strict... I’m just concerned for her safety.

Of course, Your Majesty. But I must admit, now I’m quite curious about this Keyhole.

That need not concern you, Sebastian. Have you anything to report?

Just as you suspected, Your Majesty, they seem to be coming from Ursula’s grotto.

I knew it. That sea witch is up to no good again.

I see exile from the palace has taught her nothing.

Yes, she poses serious danger.

And I told you to keep Ariel away from such danger, did I not?

Your Majesty, please, I, uh...

Come to my grotto. I want to show you something.

There it is. See?

Look at all the wonderful things Flounder and I’ve collected. I think it’s all from the outside world.

Someday, I’m going to see what’s out there. I want to see other worlds. Does that sound strange?

No. Not at all. I used to feel the same way.

Used to?

I mean...I still do.

Hey, why don’t we try looking for that Keyhole you were talking about?

But your father said—

Oh, he treats me like a little girl. He never wants to let me do anything. He just... He just doesn’t understand.

There’s this really big fish who can swim against the current. But he’s scared of those weird things swimming around. So if we chase them away, I think the big fish’ll play with us. Maybe if you grab onto him, he’ll take you somewhere.

Those impudent fools will never find the Keyhole.

But the girl could prove useful. And I’ve got the Heartless on my side.

Triton, my old friend... Your day is coming.

Hm. Its shape reminds me of something...

Ariel, you’ve disobeyed me again!

I told you not to leave the palace!

Daddy, no!

How could you...

Young man, you’re not from another ocean. You’re from another world. Aren’t you?

Huh?

Then you must be the key bearer.

How did you know?

You may fool Ariel, but you can’t fool me. You don’t know your dorsal fin from your tail.

Aw...

As the key bearer, you must already know... One must not meddle in the affairs of other worlds.

Of course I know that, but...

You have violated this principle. The key bearer shatters peace and brings ruin.

Aw, Sora’s not like that.

I thank you for saving my daughter. But there is no room in my ocean for you or your key.

My, my, the poor child suffers such deep sorrow.

What a pity. If only there were something we could do...

Wait. Maybe she can be of some help.

Yes. Maybe she can be of some help to you.

Who’re you talking about?

Oh, she would surely help you.

She’d make all your dreams come true.

Ursula can help...

You called, my dear?

You’re Ursula? I was just wondering if—

It’s all right. Helping others is what I live for. Let me guess. You wish to see other worlds. That shouldn’t be too hard. After all, your new friends came from another world.

What?

But they had special help—that mysterious key.

Now, now. Cheer up, sweetie. You have something special, too.

Now listen carefully. I think the Keyhole they seek is somewhere in the palace.

Now, my dear, if you can take me there without your daddy knowing...

I can help you get to these other worlds you long for.

The trident is mine at last! And I couldn’t have done it without your help, my dear.

Ursula, no! I didn’t want this!

Why not? Aren’t you tired of following your dear daddy’s orders?

Oh, yes. We had a deal, didn’t we? Time for a little journey—to the dark world of the Heartless!

We cannot find the Keyhole.

The Keyhole is not here.

What?

Why, we have company. I’m afraid you’re a little late, handsome!

Daddy!

The trident... We must get it back.

Come on, let’s go!

Wait, I’m going with you! My father is hurt and it’s all my fault. I have to stop Ursula!

That’s right. I’m right behind you, Ariel.

Ursula draws power from her cauldron. To defeat Ursula, you must strike her cauldron with magic.

What is that thing?

Need some help? I’ll show you how it’s done.

Come out! You can’t run!

Your time has come!

Sea and wind, hear my command!

Get up and fight!

No... Impossible!

You’ll pay for this!

Let’s go. We must get the trident back.

You pathetic fools! I rule the seas now!

The sea and all its spoils bow to my power!

Hey, you. Not so fast! Get ready for this!

Hmph... Slippery little morsel.

You dare to strike me!

This won’t be pretty!

Daddy, I’m so sorry.

Please don’t be angry with her.

It’s my fault. You followed Ursula because... I wouldn’t let you follow your heart. And when you found that crystal, I lost my temper and destroyed it.

Oh, yeah, the crystal! Why did you destroy it?

The crystal held the power to reveal the Keyhole. The Keyhole is dangerous. I had to keep you away from it at any cost.

Daddy...

Key bearer, I have one more request: Seal the Keyhole. My trident also holds the power to reveal the Keyhole. Will you do it?

Of course. That’s what we had in mind from the start.

Where is the Keyhole, Daddy?

You should know better than anyone. It’s in your grotto.

Really... Sora, let’s go.

Tell me, Sora. Your world, what’s it like?

Oh, about that... Sorry for lying to you.

It’s okay. Besides, if you can travel to other worlds, maybe I can, too.

So many places I want to see... I know I’ll get there someday. I’ll find a way somehow. I’m sure of it.

Well, if you find it, do me a favor and leave me out of it.

This is from my collection. I want you to have it.

I think my magic is as good as Donald’s now.

No way! Not in a million years.

Why don’t you go see Merlin? Work more on your magic.

You’re making excellent progress. Here’s something for your effort.

Keep it up.

Look, Pooh. Something is floating this way.

I think you’re right, Piglet. What could it be?

Why, it looks like Eeyore! Hello, Eeyore, if it is you.

Hello, Pooh. Yes, it’s me. Could you pull me out? That is, if it’s not too much trouble. Of course, you don’t have to if you don’t want to.

Thank you, Pooh. Thank you, other you. You know, floating along out there, it seemed like something was missing...

And something’s still missing.

Why, Eeyore’s tail is gone! Is that what’s missing?

Let’s see... Yep, lost it again. Wonder where it went this time. It’s not much of a tail, though I’m sort of attached to it. But I don’t know why anybody’d look for it. Probably won’t find it anyway...

Sora, why don’t we all look for Eeyore’s tail?

Lost something?

Searching from a high place is the quickest way to find it!

Owl, can you fly up high and help us find Eeyore’s tail?

Sorry, but my eyes aren’t what they used to be. Too much reading, you know. But I can offer good advice! Of course, you don’t have to if you don’t want to. See that swing up there? Take Pooh there.

You’re a bit too big for the swing, but Pooh should fit nicely. I’ll tell you more when you get there.

Here’s what to do. First, get ready to push.

How?

Like this.

Like this?

How’s this?

Not bad, not bad! Here’s the next step. If you time it right, Pooh will swing higher and higher. Try it! Push too soon, Pooh won’t go any higher. Push too late, he’ll go too high.

Hm? That looks familiar...

How’s it looking?

There we go.

It’s not much of a tail, but it’s mine. Thanks, everyone.

I wish we could put the Hundred Acre Wood back the way it was, too!

Brrr! I think I spend too much time on the swing.

Thank you, Sora. This is nice and warm. You’ve helped us so much. This is just something to say thank you.

This sure is a spooky place. I’ll bet the people here are scary- lookin’ too.

Don’t worry. We look spooky, too. If they scare us, we’ll scare them right back!

You think so?

And now, allow me to introduce...

The master of terror... the king of nightmares—Jack Skellington!

Bravo, Jack! Bravo! Those ghosts will be a big hit at this year’s Halloween!

Thank you, thank you! But their movement still needs work. It’s not scary enough.

I want to strike bone-chilling terror.

I’m going to consult the doctor.

Then I’ll go attend to the decorations.

I don’t understand. Maybe the guidance system was damaged in the explosion.

Nonsense. My devices are always perfect!

Oh, I’ve got it! Why, of course! The Heartless need a heart! Doctor, do you think we can add a heart to that device?

Certainly. A heart’s not all that complicated.

Let’s get to work.

To make a heart, first take a container with a lock...

We need the key to this thing first!

You’re really gonna unlock it for them?

Why not? If they succeed, we won’t have to fight the Heartless, right? Besides, I want to see the Heartless dance, too. Don’t you?

Not really.

My! That was amazing! Uh, and you are...

Sora.

Well done, Sora! I’d like you to be a part of this year’s Halloween.

What’s this Heartless doing here?

Oh, the Heartless came to town just recently. What’s frustrating is I can’t get them to dance with me. So the doctor and I are trying to improve the guidance system. He’s quite a genius! Okay, Doctor, let’s continue. The ingredients for a heart: Pulse.

Emotion.

Terror.

Fear.

Hope and despair.

Mix them all together, and we have a heart!

It failed!

Maybe we’re missing some ingredients. Let’s try adding memory.

Sally! Sally! Good-for-nothing girl! Don’t know why I bothered creating her!

Sally’s got the memory we need. See if you can track her down.

No problem. Sora, would you like to come along?

Sure.

Jack! Jack! We have a major crisis! The Heartless are completely out of control! We can’t stop them!

Hmm... Maybe our experiment triggered something. Everything will be fine, Mayor. You have nothing to worry about.

Let’s check this place, too, once the Heartless here are out of our way.

Zero! Have you seen Sally anywhere?

Is something wrong, Jack?

No, everything’s going great. We’re going to have the best Halloween ever. All we need now is your memory.


? You mean this?

Jack, I have a bad feeling about this. Why don’t you try something else? There’s still time.

Nothing could beat what I’ve got planned!

Once we give the Heartless a heart, they’ll dance just as I envision it.

Trust me. You’re going to love it!

I have a bad feeling about this. If only Jack would reconsider... I’m happy if he’s happy, but I’m just so worried about him. I’m worried about him because I...well, I just am. Jack, why not have these kids star in the festival instead? They both look rather frightful. And funny, too. They’d be better than the Heartless.

Lock!

Shock!

Barrel!

Did you hear that?

Yeah, I sure did! A heart! What should we do?

Gosh, you really are stupid! Isn’t it obvious?

Tell Oogie Boogie.

Yes. This is it. Now, just one more ingredient. We need
to complete the heart. The mayor should know where it is.

A heart? That bonehead Jack is really making a heart? I’ll be jiggered! That works for me!

Ohh, when I get my hands on that...

Well, I’ve got no hands, but I’m still gonna nab that heart and control the Heartless.

Ghost rise from those tombstones. Check the tombstones in the order the ghosts appear. If you get it wrong, you’re in for a surprise!

Splendid! Now go look at the pumpkin.

Yes. This is it.

There you go. This time it’s sure to work.

Ya!

The nerve of those little hooligans, stealing my work!

We lost them!

Zero, after them, quick!

I knew Oogie Boogie was behind this!

We were just following orders! Oogie Boogie told us to steal the heart. It’s all Barrels fault! It was his idea to tell Oogie Boogie about the heart.

Yeah, that’s right!

B-But you guys said—

You should be ashamed!

Oogie Boogie made us do it. We had no choice.

Oogie Boogie told us not to give away his hiding place. Oh, and we’re not supposed to talk about the lever, either.

What’s he going to do with the heart? Beats me. I’d stay away from Oogie Boogie if I were you.

Hey, I was just following Oogie Boogie’s orders! We don’t have the heart! Oogie Boogie has it!

There’s no way I’m gonna take you to him! If I did that, Oogie Boogie would eat us too.

You’ll never find the green door!

Oogie Boogie, give me back the heart!

You want it? Well, then come on over and get it!

Now, let’s see if I can get their attention. (calling) Oh, Heartless!

This is it?

Nobody disrespects me! Nobody!

C’mon, baby!

Buzzsaw!

Bone Soldiers!

So, that heart was a failure after all.

Huh?

Whoa! How did he get so big?

Look! It’s brimming with the power of darkness! Oogie Boogie is drawing power from those dark globs!

So we just have to destroy those things, right?

Sally, why didn’t I listen to you?

Don’t feel bad, Jack. We’ll come up with another plan for Halloween. Next time, we’ll do it together.

I guess we have no choice. We’ll have to cancel the Heartless Halloween festival for now. Here, I want you to have this.

Visit us any time, Sora. Next year’s Halloween will be the scariest ever!

Emotion, memory... We put in all the necessary ingredients. What else do you need to make a heart? What is a heart, anyway? I can’t figure it out.

Uh, a big ship is catching up to us.

Quit gawking! That’s a pirate ship!

It’s going to ram us! Hold tight!

I didn’t think you’d come, Sora.

Good to see you again.

Where are Donald and Goofy?

Are they that important to you? More important than old friends? Instead of worrying about them, you should be asking...

...about her.

Kairi!

That’s right. While you were off goofing around, I finally found her. (Sora starts to run towards them, when a hook blocks his path)

Not so fast. No shenanigans aboard my vessel, boy.

Riku, why are you siding with the Heartless?

The Heartless obey me now, Sora. Now I have nothing to fear.

You’re stupid. Sooner or later they’ll swallow your heart.

Not a chance. My heart’s too strong.

Riku...

I’ve picked up a few other tricks as well. Like this, for instance.

You can go see your friends now.

Let’s get under way, already. And keep Sora away from Kairi until we’re ready to land.

That scurvy brat thinks he can order me around!

What shall we do, Captain Hook?

Nothing! The hold is crawling with Heartless.

Let them keep an eye on the brats.

But, Captain, you-know-who is also down—

Shh... Did you hear that, Smee? Oh, that dreadful sound!

No, Captain.

Are you quite sure? Did I imagine it? Oh, my poor nerves...

You don’t say?

Yeah, it was definitely Kairi. I’ve finally found her.

All right! A-hyuck! Then let’s go up and talk to her.

Yeah!

Sounds great. Okay, but first...how about getting off!

Oh, sorry.

Ahem!

How ya doin’ there? Looking for a way out?

Who are you?

I’m the answer to your prayers.

Okay, then. Fine. Have it your way.

But you’re stuck in here too, aren’t you?

No. I’m just waiting for someone.

Who?

Tinker Bell, what took you so long?

Great job. So you found Wendy?

Hold on. There was another girl there, too?

Are you crazy? There’s no way I’m gonna leave Wendy there!

Aha. She must be pretty jealous.

Come on, Tink! Open up the door!

Ahem!

I’m Peter Pan.

I’m Sora.

Okay, we’re in this together, but only ‘til we find Wendy.

So, uh, how come you can fly?

Anyone can fly. You wanna try?

Aw, haven’t you cooled off yet, Tink?

Just a little bit of pixie dust. There. Now you can fly.

What? So Wendy’s not one of the chosen ones?

There are seven, supposedly, and Maleficent says she’s not one of them.

Hoist anchor as soon as possible. Leave all the dead weight behind, including her.

After the trouble of capturing her? And why those seven? What is Maleficent planning, anyway?

Who knows? As long as it means getting Kairi’s heart back, I couldn’t care less.

You’re wasting your time! The Heartless has devoured that girl’s heart. I’ll stake me other hand it’s lost forever.

I will find it no matter what.

Uh, Captain...

What?

The prisoners have escaped. What’s more, Peter Pan is with them.

Blast that Peter Pan! All right, then! Bring the hostage to me cabin, Smee! Hop to it!

What is it, Tink?

Peter? Peter Pan?

Wendy!

Please hurry! The pirates are coming!

What! I’ll be right up there! Just hold on!

Wendy?

Yes?

Is there another girl in there with you?

Oh, why, yes. But she seems to be asleep. She hasn’t budged an inch.

Kairi? Kairi!

Wendy! Hey, let’s get up there!

Wendy, are you in there?

Riku, wait!

Wendy!

Come on, Tink! Not now!

Well, this is as far as I can go. I’ve gotta help Wendy.

Quite a codfish, that Riku—running off with that girl without even saying goodbye.

Run off where? Tell me, where did he go?

To the ruins of Hollow Bastion, where Maleficent resides. But you won’t be going there.

Unless you intend to leave your little pixie friend behind?

Hand over the Keyblade and I’ll spare your lives. Be glad I’m merciful, unlike the Heartless. So, which will it be? The Keyblade, or the plank?

It’s him! The crocodile that took me hand! Oh, Smee! He’s after me other hand! I can’t stay here!

Go away! Oh, I can’t stand the sight of him!

Smee, you take care of them!

Fly, Sora! Just believe, and you can do it!

Thanks, Peter.

Hey, don’t mention it. You didn’t think I’d leave you and Tink behind, did you?

You’re all going down!

Toodle-oo!

Is that you, Smee? Did you finish them off?

Aye, Captain. They walked the plank, every last one of them.

P-Peter Pa—blast you!

Ready to make a splash, you codfish? Now it’s your turn to talk the plank!

Fire!

Come and get me!

Uh, Kairi couldn’t wake up, so maybe she’s really lost her—

Shh!

Sora.

I still can’t believe it.

I really flew. Wait ‘til I tell Kairi. I wonder if she’ll believe me. Probably not.

You can bring her to Never Land sometime. Then she can try it herself.

If you believe, you can do anything, right? I’ll find Kairi. I know I will. There’s so much I want to tell her—about flying, the pirates, and everything else that’s happened.

What’s that, Tink? What about the clock tower? You say there’s something there?

Hey, Sora.

Hm?

When we grow up, let’s get off this island. We’ll go on real adventures, not this kid stuff!

Sure. But isn’t there anything fun to do now? Hey, you know the new girl at the mayor’s house? She arrived on the night of the meteor shower!

It was reckless to bring her here without at least using a vessel. Remember, relying too heavily on the dark powers could cost you your heart.

A castaway.

Though his world perished, his heart did not. When we took the princess from his castle, he apparently followed her here through sheer force of will. But fear not. No harm will come to you. He is no match for your power.

My power?

Yes, the untapped power that lies within you. Now, child, it’s time you awakened that power and realized your true potential.

Peter, are you really going back to Never Land?

Afraid so. But we can see each other any time. As long as you don’t forget about Never Land, that is.

Oh, boy. She’s getting’ steamed again. Do me a favor. Look after her for me, will ya?

What?

Peter remains with me as long as I remember him. You will find Kairi if she remains in your heart. You’ll find her Sora. Just don’t give up.

Well, we found the Navi-Gummi piece. Let’s go back to town.

Cid’ll install it on the ship once we bring it to him.

Pinocchio?

Hey, it’s Sora!

Well, hello, Sora!

How did you get here?

A man named Leon helped us. He even got us this house to live in. I don’t know how I’ll ever repay his kindness. Say, I hear you three are fighting the Heartless. I thought I might be able to help you, so I made this.

For us?

But of course! Pinocchio and I can’t thank you enough! We’ll do anything we can to help you.

I’m being good, even without Jiminy’s help.

Looks like you found the other one. Let me see it.

Okay, wait here. I’ll get it installed right now.

Sora!

Now, just remember what Donald said to ya: no frowning, no sad faces.

How can you be so cheerful? There’s still no sign of your king. Aren’t you worried?

Aw, phooey.

The king told us to go out and find the key bearer, and we found you. So as long as we stick together, it’ll all work out okay. Ya just gotta believe in yourself, that’s all.

Just believe...

I believe in you.

Where am I?

Long ago, people lived in peace, bathed in the warmth of light. Everyone loved the light. Then people began to fight over it. They wanted to keep it for themselves. And darkness was born in their hearts. The darkness spread, swallowing the light and many people’s hearts. It covered everything, and the world disappeared. But small fragments of light survived...in the hearts of children. With these fragments of light, children rebuilt the lost world. It’s the world we live in now. But the true light sleeps, deep within the darkness. That’s why the worlds are still scattered, divided from each other. But someday, a door to the innermost darkness will open. And the true light will return. So, listen, child. Even in the deepest darkness, there will always be a light to guide you. Believe in the light, and the darkness will never defeat you. Your heart will shine with its power and push the darkness away. Do you understand, Kairi?

Kairi!?

Huh?

What’s the matter?

Um, nothing. Kairi... Did you call me?

I installed that navigation gummi. But, ya know? That place is crawling with Heartless. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

Here, take this along.

Show me what you’ve got!

Hercules, wait. Let’s go one-on-one!

Oh, brother. What a show-off.

What’re we gonna do?

Let him go alone, I guess.

Good luck, Sora!

I’m not gonna go easy on you!

Wow! And I didn’t even hold back!

Now I finally know what you mean about strength of heart. Mine comes from Donald and Goofy.

Come again?

If we stick together, we’re unbeatable. Not even Hercules stands a chance.

With these guys beside me, I’m ready for anything!

But that’s not exactly what I—

Of course. Your friends give you strength. Isn’t that right, Phil? The three of you together make great heroes.

And as a team, I’m sure you can overcome anything.

Phil wasn’t happy that I lost to you. Said I was getting soft. You beat me last time, but next time won’t be so easy.

Gawrsh, look at that!

I know this place...

Hmm, that’s strange.

I wonder why... I feel this warmth inside, right here.

Aw, you’re just hungry.

Hey, I’m serious!

Let’s go!

No vessel, no help from the Heartless... So tell me, how’d you get here?

I simply believed. Nothing more to it. When our world fell into darkness, Belle was taken from me. I vowed I would find her again no matter what the cost. I believed I would find her. So, here I am. She must be here. I will have her back!

Take her, if you can!

Stop!

So, you finally made it. About time. I’ve been waiting for you. We’ve always been rivals, haven’t we? You’ve always pushed me as I’ve always pushed you.

Riku...

But it all ends here. There can’t be two Keyblade masters.

What are you talking about?

Let the Keyblade choose...

...its true master.

Huh?

What!?

Maleficent was right. You don’t have what it takes to save Kairi.

It’s up to me. Only the Keyblade master can open the secret door...

...and change the world.

But that’s impossible. How did this happen? I’m the one who fought my way here with the Keyblade!

You were just the delivery boy.

Sorry, your part’s over now. Here, go play hero with this.

Goofy. Let’s go. We have to remember our mission.

Oh! Well, I know the king told us to follow the key and all... But...

Sora, Sorry.

Hey, don’t move. You’re hurt.

Why... Why did you...you come here? I came to fight for Belle.

And though I am on my own, I will fight. I won’t leave without her. That’s why I’m here.

Me too. I’m not gonna give up now. I came here to find someone very important to me.

O purest of hearts! Reveal to me the Keyhole!

Be on your guard. They’re close, I can feel it. Are you ready for them?

Belle?

Quit while you can.

No. Not without Kairi.

The darkness will destroy you.

You’re wrong, Riku. The darkness may destroy my body, but it can’t touch my heart.

My heart will stay with my friends. It’ll never die!

Really... Well, we’ll just see about that!

Sora ain’t gonna go anywhere!

You’d betray your king?

Not on your life! But I’m not gonna betray Sora, either, ‘cause he’s become one of my best buddies after all we’ve been through together!

See ya later, Donald. Could ya tell the king I’m really sorry?

Hold on, Goofy! We’ll tell him together.

Well, you know... All for one and one for all.

I guess you’re stuck with us, Sora.

Thanks a lot... Donald, Goofy.

How will you fight without a weapon?

I know now I don’t need the Keyblade. I’ve got a better weapon. My heart.

Your heart? What good will that weak little thing do for you?

All though my heart may be weak, it’s not alone. It’s grown with each new experience, and it’s found a home with all the friends I’ve made. I’ve become a part of their heart just as they’ve become a part of mine. And if they think of me now and then...if they don’t forget me...then our hearts will be one.

I don’t need a weapon. My friends are my power!

No... Not yet...

So, your heart won this battle.

Why? It was mine.

Know this.

The heart that is strong and true shall win the Keyblade.

What? You’re saying my heart’s weaker than his?

For that instant, it was.

However, you can become stronger.

You showed no fear in stepping through the door to darkness. It held no terror for you. Plunge deeper into the darkness, and your heart will grow even stronger.

What should I do?

It’s really quite simple. Open yourself to the darkness. That is all. Let your heart, your being become darkness itself.

So, I see the path has emerged at last.

Yes. The Keyhole to the darkness.

Unlock it and the Heartless will overrun this world.

What do I care? The darkness holds no power over me. Rather, I will use its power to rule all worlds.

Such confidence.

Oh!

Impossible! The princesses of heart are all here! It must be her.

Without her heart, she will never be able to release her power.

The king’s fools are here. I’ll deal with them myself.

You stay here and guard the princesses.

I’m afraid you’re too late. Any moment now, the final Keyhole will be unsealed. This world will be plunged into darkness. It is unstoppable.

We’ll stop it! After coming this far, there’s no way we’re gonna let that happen!

You poor, simple fools. You think you can defeat me? Me, the mistress of all evil?

Now you’ll know the meaning of fear! A bolt of lightning to strike them down!

No!

Meteors of heaven, unleash thy fury!

Give me strength!

Come out!

Away!

No!

Do you need some help?

Riku!

Is that—

Yes. A Keyblade.

But unlike yours, this Keyblade holds the power to unlock people’s hearts. Allow me to demonstrate... Behold!

Wha—

Now, open your heart, surrender it to the darkness! Become darkness itself!

This is it! This power!

Darkness... The true darkness!

Step aside!

How ironic. She was just another puppet after all.

What?

The Heartless were using Maleficent from the beginning. She failed to notice the darkness in her heart eating away at her. A fitting end for such a fool.

Kairi!

Kairi! Kairi! Open your eyes!

It’s no use.

That girl has lost her heart. She cannot wake up.

What? You... You’re not Riku.

The Keyhole cannot be completed so long as the last princess of heart still sleeps.

The princess...? Kairi’s a princess?

Yes, and without her power, the Keyhole will remain incomplete. It is time she awakened.

Whoever you are, let Riku go! Give him back his heart!

But first, you must give the princess back her heart.

Sora!

What’s—

Don’t you see yet?

The princess’s heart is responding. It has been there all along. Kairi’s heart rests within you!

Kairi... Kairi’s inside me?

I know all that there is to know.

Tell me. Who are you?

It is I, Ansem, the seeker of darkness.

So, I shall release you now, Princess. Complete the Keyhole with your power. Open the door, lead me into everlasting darkness!

Sora!

Forget it! There’s no way you’re taking Kairi’s heart!

Come!

Now witness true power!

Behold the power of darkness!

Riku!

Sora! Sora, look!

The... The Keyhole!

It won’t work! The Keyhole’s not finished yet!

What can we do?

Maybe we’ve gotta go wake Kairi up.

I think you’re right.

If we can free her heart... But... But how?

A Keyblade that unlocks people’s hearts... I wonder.

Sora?

Sora, hold on!

No, wait!

Sora... Sora!

Sora!

Sora! Come back, Sora!

What’s... What’s happening to me? Falling...falling...into darkness.

Sora, are you really—No. He can’t be! I won’t let him go!

So, you have awakened at last, Princess. The Keyhole is now complete. You have served your purpose. But now it’s over.

Don’t make another move!

Do you think we can stop him all by ourselves?

I don’t know!

Impossible...

No. You won’t use me for this!

Riku!

You’ve got to run! The Heartless are coming!

What about the Keyhole?

Let’s just get out of here!

Kairi, hurry!

I can’t leave them behind!

We can’t stay here!

I’ll take care of him!

Confounded Heartless! Get lost, will ya?

Sora? Is that you?

Uh-oh!

This time, I’ll protect you.

Sora!

Kairi!

Kairi, thank you.

Sora...

Sora!

Go! Now!

Come with us!

I told you before, I’m not leaving without Belle. Now, go! The Heartless are coming!

All right. Let’s get out of here.

Tell me what happened.

So the darkness is flowing out of that Keyhole...

No wonder there are more and more Heartless everywhere. The only way to stop them is—

Seal the Keyhole, right?

Maybe. But no one knows what will happen once it’s sealed.

Well, we can’t just stay here. We have to do something. I’ve got a friend back there.

That’s right. You have one more friend to worry about. Riku’s Keyblade must have been born of the captive princesses’ hearts—just like that Keyhole you saw.

Of course, without Kairi’s heart, it remained incomplete. Once that Keyblade was destroyed, the princesses’ hearts should have been freed. Don’t worry, Sora. If anyone can save your friend, you can.

Not sure why, but the Heartless are getting stronger. New types of Heartless are popping up all over the place! If anything happens to us, I know we can count on you, Sora.

Even in your Heartless form, I knew it was you.

I thought the Keyhole would strength the darkness. I mean the darkness is strong, but still... It’s almost as if someone is holding the darkness back.

It seems the other princesses have been freed as well. Jasmine apparently hasn’t returned to Agrabah. I suspect the others are still in the castle, too.

Do you remember seeing a man with spiky hair at the coliseum?

Yup.

I wonder if he’s still searching for his friend? Sora. If you see him, please tell him to be careful. He’s not that friendly, but we all care about him dearly.

Cid, I need to go back to Hollow Bastion.

I don’t think I can let you do that, kid. The Heartless there are multiplying by the minute. They’d eat your ship up.

Then what can we do?

Simple. Go around ‘em instead of through. Install a new navigation gummi and take a new route.

A new gummi? From where?

The secret waterway. When I came here 9 years ago, I stored it there in case I ever needed it. Never thought a kid would be the one to use it!

What a mysterious mural... It’s almost hypnotizing.

Let’s go back and join the others. We should rest up

Okay.

A light at the end of the tunnel...

Oh, your grandma’s story, right?

That’s right. We were together.

You know what’s funny? I looked everywhere for you, but you were with me all along. Finally, we’re together, Kairi.

Now, it’s time to get Riku back.

You think it’ll ever be the same again between us? Riku’s lost his...

When I turned into a Heartless, you saved me, remember?

I was lost in the darkness. I couldn’t find my way. As I stumbled through the dark, I started forgetting things—my friends, who I was. The darkness almost swallowed me. But then I heard a voice—your voice. You brought me back.

I didn’t want to just forget about you, Sora. I couldn’t.

That’s it! Our hearts are connected.

And the light from our hearts broke through the darkness. I saw that light. I think that’s what saved me. No matter how deep the darkness, a light shines within. I guess it’s more than just a fairy tale.

Well, let’s go.

You can’t go.

Why not?

Because it’s way too dangerous.

Come on, Sora. We made it this far by sticking together. You can’t go alone.

Kairi, even if we’re apart, we’re not alone anymore. Right?

I can’t help?

You’d kind of be in my way.

Okay. You win.

Take this.

It’s my lucky charm. Be sure to bring it back to me.

Don’t worry. I will.

Promise?

Promise.

Don’t ever forget. Wherever you go, I’m always with you.

Sora... Kairi... I’m sorry...

Is this the afterworld?

I’m not ready. Not yet. Not until I see Sora and Kairi one last time...

Riku, can you hear me? I’ll be there soon.

Who is that?

I have the other Keyblade—the one that belongs to this world.

I’ve been trying to get through to you, but the darkness in your heart kept me away.

Who are you? What’s happened to me?

Your heart won the battle against the darkness, but it was too late for your body. That’s why you’re here—in this place of darkness where hearts are gathered.

So what do I do?

The Door of Darkness will open soon, but it’s a door we can’t enter. It has to be closed from both sides. To do this, you need two keys and two hearts. Maybe you’re here for the same reason I am. Maybe it was fate.

Fate, huh? You seem to know everything, don’t you? Then tell me: Are Sora and Kairi okay?

Don’t you feel the echoes of their hearts? You already know the answer. Look inside your own heart.

Okay.

You found it? All right, I’ll go fix up your ship.

This here is my bouncin’ spot! We can bounce around here all day!

Nothing beats bouncin’!

You wanna bounce, too, Sora? It’s lotsa fun!

Okay!

To bounce with the finest, you’ll need some pointers from the finest.

But, Owl, you don’t bounce around like we do!

I’m afraid you’re right. I can’t master everything, I suppose.

Bounce this way, please!

Here’s a little warm-up.

Now it gets tricky!

You’re doin’ fantastical! This’ll be the last one.

You’ve gotten mighty good at bouncin’, Sora! Right, Roo?

Hey, Tigger! I think he’s ready for the big one!

Well, there’s only one way to find out!

This tree doesn’t have honey, I see.

I wonder what this is.

Rare nuts grow on these trees. I’ll trade you things for them.

Look at all these nuts! We couldn’t have done it without you. What are they for? It’s a secret.

Oh, another summon gem? Let’s help this little one. Here we go! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

Thank you, Sora. Here’s something for you.

Take good care of them.

All set! You can get going any time. Kid, I gotta say, I wish you didn’t have to face all this danger. Don’t get cocky just ‘cause you’ve been there before. That castle’s probably crawling with ‘em now...

There’s a new warp hole near Traverse Town.

I wonder where it leads... Hmm. Some weird power is emanating from the worlds.

Might be worth revisiting some places again.

Yo, hey, how’re you doin’ everybody, yeah. Got a minute? Hades, Lord of the Dead. Nice to see you. Hey, guess what? I got a place for you down under!

Feel the heat...

That all you’ve got?

That’s it!

Oh! Hey, kid, wh-what are you doing?

Stop! Hey, guys! G-Get away from me! Come on! Come on!

Sora!

Sora!

Where’s Belle?

Still in the castle.

Against her will?

No, I think she stayed for a reason. The other princesses are inside as well.

I wonder why?

Let’s go ask them.

You may need my strength. I’ll go with you.

Belle!

You’ve come to seal the Keyhole, right? Please, be careful. The darkness is raging deep inside. We’ve been holding it back, but we can’t hold out much longer.

We’ll take care of it.

This is for you. Use it to face the darkness, as the Beast has.

So many books, but not one on how to banish the darkness. Maybe it’s hopeless...

We’ve been waiting for you, Keyblade master.

Where’s Ansem?

Gone.

When the Keyhole appeared, darkness poured out of it. It swallowed Ansem, and he disappeared.

Though Ansem is gone, the flood of darkness hasn’t stopped. We’re working together to hold it back.

I cannot forget the look on his face. As the darkness engulfed him, he was smiling.

Sora, please hurry! Darkness is pouring from the Keyhole.

It’s all we can do just to hold back the darkness.

I don’t even know how long we can manage even that.

All right, I’m on my way.

We’re counting on you, Keyblade master. In the meantime, we’ll do what we can, too.

Ansem has ignored us since the Keyhole appeared.

I don’t think Ansem will ever return.

We must close the Keyhole before it’s too late.

Can you feel the immense power flowing from that Keyhole?

Please hurry. Our strength is running out.

Now let’s go and seal that big Keyhole!

Sora. You did it.

What are you guys doing here?

We came in Cid’s ship.

This is our childhood home. We wanted to see it again.

It’s in worse shape than I feared. It used to be so peaceful...

Don’t worry. If we defeat Ansem, all should be restored. Including your island.

Really?

But, it also means goodbye.

Once the worlds are restored, they’ll all be separate again.

Everyone will go back to where they came from.

Then I’ll visit you guys with the gummi ship.

It’s not that simple.

Before all this, you didn’t know about the other worlds, right?

Because every world was isolated. Impassable walls divided them.

The Heartless destroyed those walls. But if the worlds return, so will the walls.

Which means gummi ships will be useless.

So you’re saying we’ll never...?

We may never meet again, but we’ll never forget each other.

No matter where we are, our hearts will bring us together again.

Besides, I couldn’t forget you even if I wanted to.

What’s that supposed to mean?

Sora!

Hurry! Come and close the Keyhole!

Sora, good luck.

Thank you, Sora. I think the darkness has begun to weaken.

But I can feel a powerful darkness growing somewhere far away.

It’s the heart of the darkness. It must be where Ansem went.

Then we’ll take the gummi ship and deal with both Ansem and the Heartless.

A worthy answer, Keyblade master. We offer this power to aid your battle.

Sora, your courage can bring back our worlds.

Once the darkness is gone, all should return to its original state.

Kairi will be back on the island?

Most certainly. And you should be, too.

I can’t go home ‘til I find Riku and the king.

I still can’t believe we played a part in opening the Keyhole. To think we had such a power... Simply unimaginable! My world is gone, so I suppose I must stay here for the time being.

The darkness still lingers, so we’ll stay as well. Otherwise, this world will be destroyed, too. We’ll do all we can. You helped me during that silly trial. Now it’s my turn to help you.

Maleficent used to live in our world. She used her great powers to control the darkness... But eventually it came to control her. I’m so glad the others are here with me.

The darkness took my home. I don’t know where to go now. I hope my loved ones are safe somewhere. I’ll do whatever I can to keep this world from being taken, too. I just want everything back as it was before.

Please don’t tell Aladdin about all this. He will worry to death if you do! I will tell him about it, once I return to Agrabah. I hope everything is all right in Agrabah.

Sora, you should read this.

Read what?

It’s the rest of Ansem’s report. Maleficent must have collected it.

Ansem disappeared when this world fell to the darkness. It was believed he died defending people from the Heartless. But Ansem was the one who brought them here. Ansem waits in darkness. But here’s a little light to protect you, Sora.

Read that report and you’ll understand Ansem’s intentions. I believe the worlds can be restored. They are still alive.

Ansem and Maleficent were both possessed by darkness. You know, I just don’t get it. What’s so great about the darkness?

This was once Ansem’s castle. He was widely respected as a wise man. But darkness took him. He began experimenting with people’s hearts. Heh, some wise man. So much suffering and ruin, and for what?

This is my home, but it just doesn’t feel like it. I don’t remember much, ‘cause I was only a kid.

We thought this was Maleficent’s doing. But she was just another puppet of the darkness. Just like Ansem. This darkness is our real enemy. But how to beat it? Well, first things first. Let’s purge every last Heartless we can find.

There are no Heartless here, so rest up. We’ve gotta get rid of the Heartless and rebuild this world.

I won’t use my real name until this world is restored.

Ansem desires the darkness. He thinks it’s the source of all power. What nonsense. Darkness may shroud light, but it can never extinguish it. Sora, don’t succumb to the darkness. You and the Keyblade can defeat it.

I’ve been looking for you.

As have I.

As long as you exist, I’ll never wake from this nightmare. You’re my darkness.

I’m a part of you, am I? Then join me in this eternal nightmare untarnished by light.

Could the appearance of that gate be a bad omen?

There’s an ominous presence beyond the gate.

What is this feeling? It’s different from darkness... Be careful, Sora!

I sense a presence coming from that gate... But it’s not darkness. It’s another power altogether. It may be even more dangerous than darkness.

We could suppress the power if it were darkness. But this is different. It’s a force unlike darkness... A force different from both the light and the darkness.

Who are you?

Ah, it seems you are special, too.

Ansem?

That name rings familiar.

You remind me of him.

What’s that supposed to mean?

It means you are not whole.

You are incomplete. Allow me—to test your strength.

Impressive.

This will be enjoyable.

What are you talking about?

It is beyond your comprehension, for now.

Until we meet again.

Wait, what are you—

I am—

...but a mere shell.

What are you doing, Pooh?

Shh. Quiet, or they’ll get away!

Who?

The people who took everyone away. See their footprints? We were all sticking together to make sure no one got lost again. But then, I saw some footprints that needed following. So I did. Suddenly, everyone was gone. Bad people must have taken them away!

Actually, Pooh, I think those footprints are... Um... Anyway, I’ll help you look for your friends.

Eeyore?

Hello.

What are you doing?

Lookin’ for sticks to build my house...again.

Sticks for your house?

This place already feels like a house... Seems like a great spot to gather everyone once we find them.

I saw Pooh walkin’ away, so I bounced after him! Then I bounced a bit too high, and I lost sight of ol’ Pooh Bear!

I tried bouncin’ as high as Tigger. I was so busy tryin’ to bounce, I forgot to watch where I was bouncin’!

Hello, Piglet. So this is where you’ve been. Maybe I should bring Pooh along.

I thought I’d better have a word with Roo about his bouncing. The next thing I knew, quite to my surprise, I was lost, too!

Owl looked so intent on something, well, I just had to follow him! But then Owl flew off into the sky, and there I was, all by myself.

Hello, Piglet.

Pooh! Where are we?

I don’t know where we are either, Piglet. But if we go back the way we came, we should find home.

I got scared when everyone disappeared, so I hid.

Everyone’s here!

I’m so glad we’re all together again.

I didn’t know what to do when I was all alone.

Aw, Piglet, you gotta be brave.

You weren’t lonely at all?

Lonely? Are you kiddin’? I’m a Tigger! The most wonderful thing about Tiggers is I’m the only one. But I do admit, friends are awfully fun, too!

Think, think, think.

Hey, Pooh, what are you thinking about now?

Oh, well, I’m just thinking about what to think about.

Well, I’m off.

Sora, where are you going?

I’m gonna go look for my friends. They’re waiting for me.

Bounce on back again!

I hope you find your friends!

Sora, don’t forget... We shall always be here.

If you’d like to visit again, that is.

You’ve been a great help, Sora. Thank you! You helped Pooh get honey from the bees. You helped protect Rabbit’s carrots. You helped find Eeyore’s lost tail. You bounced along with Tigger and Roo. And you found all of us when we were lost. We can’t thank you enough. This is from all of us in the Hundred Acre Wood.

Gawrsh, is that all that’s left of the worlds taken by the Heartless?

Those worlds will be restored if we beat Ansem, right?

You betcha.

But, if we do beat him and all these worlds become restored and disconnected, what’s gonna happen to this place? And to us?

Well, uh...

This is a Heartless world, so maybe it’ll just disappear.

Huh?!

But no worries. Even if this place goes poof, our hearts ain’t goin’ nowhere. I’m sure we’ll find our pals again. Yup, I just know that we will.

Yeah, you’re right.

I’ll return this. I promise.

I wonder where that Ansem feller went?

Dive into the most dangerous place and we’ll find him!

Huh?

What’s wrong?

Don’t you hear something? There!

Careful. This is the last haven you’ll find here. Beyond, there is no light to protect you. But don’t be afraid. Your heart is the mightiest weapon of all. Remember, you are the one who will open the door to the light.

I don’t hear anything.

Strange... That voice was so familiar. Maybe it’s just my imagination.

Maybe you’d better take a rest!

Is this... Is this my island?

This world has been connected.

What was that?

Tied to the darkness... Soon to be completely eclipsed.

There is so very much to learn.

You understand so little.

A meaningless effort. One who knows nothing can understand nothing.

Take a look at this tiny place. To the heart seeking freedom this is a prison surrounded by water. And so this boy sought out to escape from his prison.

He sought a way to cross over into other worlds. And he opened his heart to darkness.

Riku!

Don’t bother. Your voice can no longer reach him where he is. His heart belongs again to darkness. All worlds begin in darkness, and all so end. The heart is no different.

Darkness sprouts within it, it grows, consumes it. Such is its nature. In the end, every heart returns to the darkness whence it came.

You see, darkness is the heart’s true essence.

That’s not true! The heart may be weak. And sometimes it may even give in. But I’ve learned that deep down, there’s a light that never goes out!

So, you have come this far and still you understand nothing. Every light must fade, every heart return to darkness!

Come, Guardian!

Submit!

Come. Open your heart...

My strength returns.

Wha...?

Behold the endless abyss! Within it lies the heart of all worlds:

Kingdom Hearts! Look as hard as you are able. You’ll not find even the smallest glimmer of light. From those dark depths are all hearts born. Even yours.

Darkness conquers all worlds!

Giving up already? Come on, Sora. I thought you were stronger than that.

Turn to darkness!

All shall be extinguished. (Orbs appear around Sora, and before he has a chance to duck, he is hit by a cluster of lasers. Sora flies downward away from them, but also away from Ansem)

Come forth.

Sora!

Sora!

Give me strength!

Let me at him!

Come on!

Come...darkness!

Now...you weak-hearted fools...witness real power!

Now show me what your precious light can do.

Still confused? Then perhaps this will enlighten you!

Welcome the darkness into your heart.

Is this the answer? I can’t be...

It is futile. The Keyblade alone cannot seal the door to darkness.

Kingdom Hearts! Fill me with the power of darkness...

Supreme darkness...

You’re wrong. I know now, without a doubt, Kingdom Hearts... is light!

Light...

But... Why...

Come on!

Stop staring and keep pushing!

Huh?!

The Heartless!?

Hurry!

I can’t...

Don’t give up!

Come on, Sora! Together, we can do it!

Okay!

It’s hopeless!

Huh?

Your Majesty!

Now, Sora! Let’s close this door for good!

Close it, quick!

But...

Don’t worry. There will always be a door to the light.

Sora, you can trust King Mickey.

Now! They’re coming!

Donald, Goofy, thank you.

Take care of her.

Kairi!

Sora!

Kairi, remember what you said before? I’m always with you, too.

I’ll come back to you. I promise!

I know you will!

Well, now what do we do?

We’ve gotta find Riku and King Mickey.

But, uh, where do we start lookin’ for that there door to the light?

Pluto?

Hey, Pluto. Where have you been?

Huh?

Hey!

Gawrsh, that’s the king’s seal!

Hey, have you seen King Mickey?

Guys, let’s go!

Remember, Sora. You are the one who will open the door to the light.
