        <cutscene>
                <desc>The clouds part and the words rush the screen. A boy awakes, floating in a
                        strange abyss, the keychain around his neck waving in the current of wind
                        blowing upwards. Gold letters appear in the void</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> I've been having these weird thoughts lately... Like, is
                        any of this for real or not?</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>The words fade away. The boy's heart pumps as he falls deeper into the abyss,
                        his eyes closed. The empty nothingness becomes water, and bubbles form in
                        the wake of his descent. He reaches a barrier and his eyes blink open with a
                        flash. He finds himself standing on a sandy beach on a clear sunny day. He
                        looks around and sees another boy in the water. Holding his hand up to block
                        the glare of the sun, he steps toward the boy in the water to get a closer
                        look. Suddenly, the ocean waters recede. He looks up and gasps. The boy in
                        the water, turns his head, the breeze billowing through his silver hair, as
                        a wave forms beyond. He smirks, holding his hand out as the wave reaches its
                        pinnacle behind him. The boy with brown hair runs toward the boy in the
                        water, who isn't moving. Time seems to slow down as the wave crashes down on
                        top of them. The first boy spins in the water, gritting his teeth. He rights
                        himself and stares at the other boy, who is unfazed, saying nothing with his
                        arm beckoning. The first boy tries to reach him, but is swept away with the
                        current. He eventually surfaces, gasping for air, the water dripping off of
                        him as the sun hangs low in the sky. He sees a girl on the shore waving to
                        him and calling his name. He waves back and starts padding towards shore as
                        she bounces happily on her feet. The girl stands with her hands behind her
                        back as he arrives. He bends down slightly, catching his breath and smirks
                        up at her. She giggles until something in the sky catches her attention, her
                        face forming a serious look. He stands up and turns around. A meteor shower
                        rains down from the sky, a shadowy figure among them. They stare in awe, and
                        the boy realizes the figure is himself. He gasps and feels himself falling.
                        He becomes the figure in the sky as he falls below the girl, reaching out to
                        her. She reaches out to him until the image of her ripples in water
                        reflecting the sky. The boy falls back, eyes closed, sinking deeper as
                        bubbles trail him. He stirs awake and manages to right himself before
                        settling onto a dark platform. He looks around and takes a step forward.
                        There is a flash of blinding light as a large flock of birds rise from the
                        platform, flying in all directions and scattering feathers everywhere. The
                        boy shields his eyes as the wind whips at him. He watches them leave while
                        the last feathers fall. The platform now depicts a girl taking a bite out of
                        an apple. The boy turns around seeing no one, yet hearing a voice</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> So much to do, so little time... Take your time. Don't
                        be afraid. The door is still shut. Now, step forward. Can you do it?</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>The boy takes a few slow steps forward. A light shines down from above as a
                        large stone pedestal rises from the platform in a shower of light and magic.
                        The boy turns toward it. A red shield blinks into existence, floating above
                        it</desc>

            <speaker>Voice</speaker> The power of the mystic. Inner strength. A staff of

                <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> The power of the warrior. Invincible courage. A sword
                        of terrible destruction. You give up this power?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>????</speaker> Yes.</sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> You've chosen the power of the mystic. You've given up

        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>The three stones suddenly sink into the floor, knocking the boy back onto the
                        platform. The ground rumbles and he looks around. The edges of the platform
                        crumble off and the platform shatters. The boy falls through darkness and
                        lands on another platform, this time depicting a girl in a beautiful silver
                        ball gown. The staff appears in his hand</desc>

                <desc>The boy defeats all of the Shadows. A black void appears in the center of the
                        platform and he is sucked into it. He bats the darkness away and wakes up on
                        a multicolored platform with three silhouettes. He sees a door near the
                        platform edge and walks toward it, examining it</desc>

                <desc>A treasure chest appears and he opens it. He turns around and a large crate
                        and barrel appear. He smashes these items and opens the door. Light floods
                        out from it and he walks through, squinting his eyes through the bright
                        light. He arrives on a small island bridge where three kids stand quietly
                        waiting</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> Hold on. The door won't open just yet. First, tell me

                <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> You want friendship. You want to be strong. You're
                        afraid of being indecisive. Your adventure begins in the dead of night. Your
                        road won't be easy, but a rising sun awaits your journey's end.</sp>

        <cutscene>
                <desc>There is a flash of light and the boy finds himself on a platform of a
                        sleeping woman clutching a rose. He walks across the platform and is
                        surrounded by Shadows. He defeats them all and a light shines down,
                        producing a glowing green circle, power radiating from it. He stands on the
                        green circle and his cuts and bruises heal. The light splits off toward the
                        edge of the platform and stairs of stained glass appear. The boy runs up the
                        stairs onto another platform depicting a woman in a yellow dress and a
                        hideous monster</desc>

        <cutscene>
                <desc>The shadow takes on the form of Darkside as the boy runs to the edge of the
                        platform, nearly falling off. He turns to face Darkside as it rises to its
                        full towering height, gazing at him with eerie glowing eyes. The staff
                        appears in his hand and he stares at his only option. Darkside summons a
                        ball of energy and punches the floor. The boy trembles as a void of darkness
                        appears in the floor, summoning several Shadows. The boy swallows his fear
                        and attacks them, while dodging larger blows from Darkside. As it punches
                        the ground again, the boy seizes the opportunity and strikes at its wrist.
                        Catching its attention, he jumps back and the staff vanishes from his hand.
                        Terror fills his face as he is left weaponless and Darkside slams his fist
                        into the ground, narrowly missing him. Sora falls in defeat and a dark void
                        appears under him, sucking him in</desc>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I'd like to see it too. Along with any other worlds out
                        there. I wanna see 'em all!</sp>

            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Who knows? If we have to, we'll think of something

                <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> So, suppose you get to another world. (giggle) What
                        would you do there?</sp>
                <sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> It's just... I've always wondered why we're here on this
                        island. If there are any other worlds out there, why did we end up on this
                        one? And suppose there are other worlds... Then ours is just a little piece
                        of something much greater. So we could've just as easily ended up somewhere
                        else, right?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora (laying down on the tree)</speaker> I don't know.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Exactly. That's why we need to go out there and find
                        out. Just sitting here won't change a thing. It's the same old stuff. So
                        let's go.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> You've been thinking a lot lately, haven't you?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Thanks to you. If you hadn't come here, I probably
                        would've never thought of any of this. Kairi, thanks.</sp>

                        brooms carrying buckets. Donald stops in front of two enormous double doors.
                        He clears his throat and knocks on three times. A smaller door just his size
                        opens and he walks through</desc>

                        Donald opens it and reads the letter. He blinks for a second, then suddenly
                        speeds back out into the Colonnade. He races across the courtyard to where
                        Goofy, Captain of the Royal Knights, is sleeping</desc>

                        down and strikes Goofy in the side, jolting him awake. He sits up sleepily

                        the lookout tower and across the bridge. He runs up the hill towards the

            <speaker>Tidus</speaker> I think you've gotten stronger, but odds are you're
                        still no match for Riku. We took him on three-to-one last time, and he
                        whipped us all. Well, I guess Kairi can always count on him.</sp>

                <desc>Sora walks across the bridge and climbs a tree to retrieve a seagull egg and
                        some coconuts. He enters the Seaside Shack and walks down the stairs to the
                        beach floor. He walks along the beach and sees Wakka</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Wakka</speaker> Me and Tidus, we are gonna do a little explorin' today.
                        You know, to the secret place at the base of that tree. There's gotta be
                        something there, ya?</sp>

        <cutscene>
                <desc>Sora enters the Secret Place and walks through an underground tunnel, with
                        roots lining the walls. He reaches a room made of walled boulders with chalk
                        drawings scrawled on them. The only light is from a small hole in the
                        ceiling. Sora sees the last mushroom near a wooden board in the wall and
                        plucks it from the ground. Behind the mushroom is an old drawing of Kairi
                        and Sora that brings memories flooding back to him. He kneels on the ground,
                        placing a hand on the drawing of Kairi with a soft smile. His mind flashes
                        back to the two of them as 5 year olds when they drew each other on the
                        walls. Sora sits, picking up a rock and begins carving. He stops and stares
                        at his work. He is giving Kairi a paopu fruit. Suddenly, he hears a noise
                        behind him and stands up swiftly</desc>

                <sp>

                <desc>Sora looks toward the board in the wall. It resembles a door, but with no lock
                        or doorknob. As Sora turns back to the figure in the shadows, it has
                        disappeared. With nothing left to do, he returns to the raft, where Kairi is
                        leaning against the mast fiddling with something jingling in her

            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> This? I’m making a necklace of thalassa shells. In the
                        old days, sailors always wore thalassa shells. They were supposed to ensure

                        him, and stick with him. Got it? We need that key or we’re doomed! So go to
                        Traverse Town and find Leon. He’ll point you in the right direction.P.S.

                        Mechanical arms hang down from the ceiling around a small orange spaceship.
                        The dome of the cockpit reveals three seats. Donald walks toward a large
                        golden tube and puts a hand to his mouth</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Donald</speaker> Hello up there? Donald Duck to launch crew! Anytime

        <cutscene>
                <desc>In a hanging control booth, Donald’s voice echoes out of the other end of the
                        tube into the ears of a black-nosed chipmunk wearing an apron. Chip salutes
                        and a second chipmunk, this time with a red nose, runs toward a control
                        panel. Dale jumps up to turn a blue lever. Steam billows out of pipes in the
                        ceiling as more gears spin on the walls. Dale leaps to the window and the
                        two chipmunks watch a mechanical hand move across the room. The hand picks
                        up Goofy, carrying him upside down with his arms outstretched. Donald, at
                        his annoyance of being lifted the same way, crosses his arms and frowns. As
                        the cockpit opens, Pluto runs into the room and jumps into the Gummi Ship. A
                        light spins on the wall as an interstellar runway opens, lights blinking
                        along the path. A lift moves the rocket ship, aiming it at the tunnel, as
                        Daisy and Queen Minnie enter the room to see their departure. Donald gives
                        Daisy a thumbs-up and a wink as the rockets engines start up with a shower
                        of flames. Donald points forward to the tunnel</desc>

        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>In the tunnel, a large neon arrow blinks on, pointing downward. The shaft
                        below the Gummi Ship opens, and the ship falls through it, Donald and Goofy
                        screaming. The ship drops out of the world and the engine bursts on, sending
                        them into space. Meanwhile, Sora sits alone in his bedroom in the Destiny
                        Islands. His window is open slightly, the only light coming from the moon
                        outside and his dim desk lamp. Clothes and books are piled on the floor as
                        he lies on the bed, peering over at a hanging model of a wooden ship with a
                        boy and a girl passenger. Sora’s thoughts drift to his earlier conversation
                        with Kairi on the dock</desc>

                <desc>Thunder rumbles softly outside, catching Sora’s attention and he gazes
                        outside. In the darkness of the cloudy night sky, lightning flashes,
                        striking near the small island</desc>

            <speaker>Sora’s Mom</speaker> Sora, dinner’s ready. Come on down. Sora?</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>The room is empty. Sora arrives at the small island, spotting a large orb of
                        energy hanging low in the sky, wind swirling in it dark depths</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What’s that?</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>Sora jumps onto the dock, seeing two other boats moored there</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Riku’s boat. And Kairi’s!</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>He looks around warily, seeing no one. In the dim landscape a pair of eyes
                        emerges from the ground. The eyes illuminated the Shadow’s body, its
                        antennae wriggling as it scans its surroundings. Another appeared and Sora
                        gasps in fear. He takes out his wooden sword as one of them leaps at him,
                        but he blocks the strike. He tries to hit them with the sword, but they seem
                        unfazed by it. It feels to Sora as if it goes right through the creatures.
                        Sora realizes his only option is to run and he makes his way to the wooden
                        bridge, dodging strikes from the Shadows. Everywhere he runs, more appear in
                        his wake. He sees Riku standing at the small island across the bridge,
                        facing the orb in the sky. He appears unmoving, as if in a trance</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Where’s Kairi? I thought she was with you!</sp>

                        We may never see our parents again. There’s no turning back. But this may be
                        our only chance. We can’t let fear stop us! I’m not afraid of the
                        darkness!</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>He holds out a hand toward Sora</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora (uneasily)</speaker> Riku...</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>A pool of darkness forms at Riku’s feet, its tendrils licking at where he
                        stands, wrapping around his impassive body. Sora rushes forward to save his
                        friend, and the darkness grabs at him. He tries to reach toward Riku, but
                        the weight of the darkness pulls him down. Riku’s face is unchanging as Sora
                        fails to grab his hand, the darkness proving too much for him. He blacks out
                        for a second before a light twinkles into existence. It starts out small,
                        but soon grows into an incredible brightness. It fills Sora’s vision and he
                        feels something metallic fall into his hand. He opens his eyes, nearly
                        stumbling forward as the light dissipates. He stares at the large object in
                        his hand. Its golden handle and silver blade shines like a sword, but the
                        tip of the blade is pointed like the teeth of a key. A keychain hangs from
                        the pommel of the weapon. A name whispers softly in Sora’s ear</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Voice</speaker> Keyblade... Keyblade...</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>Shadows appear around him and he swung at them with the Keyblade. A Shadow,
                        unable to dodge, is knocked backward in a flurry of stars. With a few more
                        swings, the darkness of the Shadows is driven away by the might of the
                        blade, and they vanish. With as many as he defeats, more appear and Sora
                        races back across the bridge. He sees a strange door over the entrance to
                        the Secret Place. The door opens and he runs inside to find...</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Kairi!</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>She stands heavily in front of the door-like wall of the cave. A soft hum
                        hangs in the air as she slowly turns toward him, her empty eyes weak with
                        exhaustion</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Sora...</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>Sora is startled to see her like this as she struggles to move forward to him,
                        lifting a hand toward him. Suddenly, the door behind her gives way and a
                        great wind billows forth. Sora stands his ground, covering his face as Kairi
                        loses her grip, flying toward him. He opens his arms to catch her, but just
                        as she reaches him, she vanishes and he catches nothing. Astonished by this,
                        he loses his ground as the dark wind knocks him harshly out of the cave. He
                        comes to on the beach with a grunt, the purple sky stretching around the
                        island. Sora kneels in the sand looking around at the island below him.
                        Large chunks of the island have broken off and risen into the sky towards
                        the dark orb</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Whoa!</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>The orb looms above him, lightning crackling in its dark depths as the wind
                        swirls in the air with rocky and wooden debris. Sora senses a presence
                        behind him, and stands, turning around to see the demon from his dreams,
                        Darkside, gazing down at him through black tendrils. Sora takes out the
                        Keyblade as Darkside kneels on the ground. Energy pulses in the heart-shaped
                        hole in its torso and it releases beams that target Sora. Sora begins
                        attacking its arm, while dodging the beams of energy. Darkside stands, its
                        hands out of reach of Sora, and it pauses, peering at him through glowing
                        yellow eyes. Sora waits, watching its every move. It leans forward clenching
                        its hand into a fist, gathering strength, before slamming the fist into the
                        ground, spewing darkness along the sandy floor. Shadows emerge from the dark
                        pool. Sora races through them to the demon’s wrist, running along its black
                        arm. He makes his way to Darkside’s shoulder and slams the blade into the
                        creature’s face. The wind howls louder as the island creeps further toward
                        the orb of energy. Sora drops to the ground as Darkside is pulled into the
                        air. The wind whipping at him, he grabs a wooden board stuck in the sand and
                        holds on for dear life. Every muscle in his body tenses as the wind pulls
                        him upward. His fingers slowly lose their grip and he is sucked into the
                        orb, screaming. Meanwhile in a quiet village, Goofy, Donald, and Pluto walk
                        through town. Something in the sky catches Goofy’s attention and he stops,
                        gazing upward. Donald turns around as Goofy points upward. Donald follows
                        his gaze and gasps</desc>

                        similar to a Soldier, with a strange emblem on its chest. It moves
                        awkwardly, doing a somersault in the air before disappearing. Sora rushes

                <desc>A tall man enters in a leather outfit, the lion necklace swinging against his

                        gazing at Sora through his long dark hair. There is a large scar above his

                <desc>The man takes out a Gunblade, slinging it over his shoulder before holding it
                        firmly in his strong hands. He summons a Fire spell and shoots it at Sora,
                        who dodges and runs toward the man. He gets in a few hits with the Keyblade
                        before taking a large hit from the Gunblade, knocking him backward. He runs
                        further away, but the man leaps over and corners him. He leaps over the wall
                        to the main square and the man shoots another Fire spell at him, which Sora
                        blocks and sends flying back at the man. Sora stops for a second, hearing
                        nothing and runs back over the wall to find the man stunned. As he gets
                        closer, the man snaps back and strikes him hard in the chest. Sora stands
                        for a second, wobbling on his feet, before falling over backward onto the
                        cobblestone ground. The man stands back up, hearing a voice behind

        <cutscene>
                <desc>He looks toward the Keyblade in Sora’s hands. Meanwhile in another world, Riku
                        awakes on a cold stone platform. His fingers twitch and he opens his eyes,
                        seeing a large waterfall and crystalline rock platforms floating in the air.
                        The sounds of the Rising Falls fill his ears, and he slowly gets to his

                <desc>Getting no response, he stares at the tiled ground. Unbeknownst to him, his
                        arrival is noticed by a tall figure in a black cloak, who walks toward him
                        on a much higher platform. The figure’s greenish-gray hand and long violet
                        fingernails are revealed. Back in Traverse Town, Donald and Goofy walk down
                        the Alleyway in the Second District, having no luck in their search. The dim
                        light complements the empty atmosphere</desc>

                <desc>At the mention of the King, Donald stops shaking and the two of them turn to
                        see a young woman with flowing brown hair tied in a bow. She wears a long
                        pink dress and brown boots. She smiles at the two of them. Soon after, Sora
                        is starting to wake up</desc>

                        The Red Room door closes and Goofy stares at Donald flattened against the
                        wall. Down in the Alleyway, more Heartless have appeared around them</desc>

            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Don’t bother with the small fry. Find the leader! Let’s

                <desc>Leon runs down the Alley toward the door to the main district. Sora fights
                        Heartless as he makes his way to the Third District. Sora runs down the
                        stairs into the square as Goofy watches from a high balcony. Goofy turns
                        around as Heartless appear around him and Donald. He takes out his
                        shield</desc>

        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>With a loud crash, the two of them are blasted off the balcony. Sora turns,
                        hearing the commotion, and tries to run as Donald and Goofy fall on top of
                        him. Stars appear around their heads before they see the Keyblade</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Donald &amp; Goofy</speaker> The key!</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>They smile as Sora winces. The District starts to rumble and they look around,
                        still in a pile on the ground. Large blocks appear from the ground and cover
                        the exits. Heartless surround them as they stand up, ready to fight. After
                        defeating the horde of Soldiers, they hear a clattering sound from above.
                        Sora looks up to see huge pieces of armor falling from the sky. They hit the
                        ground and bounce into the air, spinning wildly. The arms of the Guard Armor
                        form around the torso, which is emblazoned with a red and black symbol. Once
                        the legs attach, the Heartless lands on the ground loudly. It stands there
                        for a moment before the helmet slams down onto the torso with a bright
                        flash. It spins its head and arms before walking toward the trio. Sora
                        attacks its arms, but it hardly recoils in its pursuit of him. Donald and
                        Goofy do their best to strike the tough armor. It begins spinning its arms
                        wildly around its body. Donald is caught in the twister and is knocked out.
                        Sora strikes at one of the arms and the Guard Armor stomps the ground in
                        anger. It jumps into the air and its pieces clatter to the ground heavily.
                        Sora strikes an arm off while Goofy heals Donald and they tag-team against
                        its thunderous legs. With the appendages destroyed, the torso is left
                        defenseless and it falls to the ground. Sora, Donald, and Goofy approach and
                        it begins spinning out of control, knocking the three of them back. Once
                        they find their footing again, Sora gives the armor a final strike and it
                        starts to explode from the inside, shaking the area around it. Its head
                        wobbles and falls to the ground with a mighty ring. A large glowing heart
                        floats out of its torso into the air and the Guard Armor disappears. The
                        District grows silent, the fountain depicting two dogs in love at the edge
                        of the area giving off the only sound. Later, Leon and Yuffie join the
                        group</desc>

                        reveals a smaller door underneath. They enter the Bizarre Room and see the
                        White Rabbit scurrying across the tiled floor, several sizes smaller than
                        before. The ticking sounds of a multitude of clocks lining the walls fills
                        their ears as they watch the rabbit run through a small wooden door with a
                        large doorknob on the edge of the room. Sora walks over to the door and
                        kneels down in front of it</desc>

                <desc>Sora turns and sees a table and chair form out of the floor. Two bottles
                        appear on the table. The trio drink from the blue bottle and shrink down to
                        the size of the door. Heartless appear and they defeat them, but by that
                        time, the doorknob has gone back to sleep and the door will not open. They
                        find another entrance to the Queen’s Castle. Several soldiers stand guard as
                        a trial is in progress inside a large hedge maze. Several roses line the
                        hedges, some red and some white. A procession of cards parts to allow the
                        trio to enter as a small blond girl in a blue pinafore dress is standing at
                        a defendant’s table. She looks up to the bench and is addressed by a large
                        scary woman wearing a crown. The White Rabbit runs up a podium and catches
                        his breath before sounding a note with a trumpet</desc>

                        over heels... And I found myself here.</sp>

                <desc>Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter the Lotus Forest and look around. A cat’s face

                        tree stump. The cat’s body appears, standing on its head rather comically.
                        It’s body is lined with purple stripes. It steps off and places its head
                        back on its body, grinning incessantly</desc>

                        some Footprints near a large flower. After climbing to one of the tree tops,
                        Sora finds a hole in the trunk of a tree. They enter it and find themselves
                        in the Bizarre Room again, this time on top of the huge stone stove. Near
                        the two burners, they find a Stench. They return to the Lotus Forest and
                        travel further in, finding a large boulder and several Dalmatian puppies.
                        They climb the boulder and reach a lily pad, where they discover an Antenna.
                        As they travel along lily pads, they see a hole in a high corner of the
                        woods. They make their way over and enter. They fall into the Bizarre Room,
                        on top of a faucet sticking out of the wall. Jumping to a nearby wooden
                        ledge, they find some Claw Marks. After saving this evidence, the Cheshire
                        Cat appears on the faucet, still grinning</desc>

                        and find another entrance to the Bizarre Room. This time, they find

                <desc>He points upward and the enormous Trickmaster Heartless appears. It lands on
                        the floor with its accordion-like hands and jumps over the table, landing on
                        its large pointed boots. It stands up to its full height, towering over the
                        table, unraveling both of its long arms. It stares down at them with its
                        five stacked heads. It folds its arms together and pulls out two giant
                        matches, twirling them in the air. Sora gets a running start, leaping off
                        the table and striking at the Trickmaster’s faces as it raises its matches
                        high in the air. It slams them down onto the chair, sending it flattened
                        into the floor. Sora jumps up, using the length of his Keyblade to deal
                        blows to the Trickmaster. He knocks it out for a second, and it falls to its
                        knees, though not for long. It starts to sing to itself and swings wildly,
                        hitting Donald, who shrieks. It continues twirling the matches, walking over
                        to the stove. It bends over the stove and lights them, sending fireballs at
                        the three of them. Goofy blocks them with his shield and Sora sends a
                        Blizzard spell, effectively putting the fire out. After several more hits,
                        the Trickmaster lowers its arms and falls to the ground. It attempts to
                        stand, but crashes to the ground, its arms laying at its side. A large heart
                        floats of its torso and it disappears. Sora hears a noise behind him and

                        is tough. You got what it takes? You ready?</sp>
                <sp>

            <speaker>Philoctetes</speaker> The rules are simple: Bust all the barrels within

                <sp>
            <speaker>Philoctetes</speaker> Well... I guess so. We start with the
                        preliminaries! Some real weirdos signed up for the games. Better watch

                <sp>
            <speaker>Hades (snappy)</speaker> I know! You think I don’t know? I wrote the
                        contract! I know it says you’re only required to kill Hercules in this
                        tournament. But you’ve gotta fight that kid to get to him. Come on.</sp>

                        attacks with his Keyblade, while Goofy moves in with his shield. Cloud
                        swings his giant sword and knocks them both back</desc>

        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>Sora slides forward and strikes, but he dodges backward and jumps into the
                        air. Cloud slams his sword into the ground with unnatural strength, knocking
                        out Donald. Giving a loud yell, Cloud surges forward and strikes, knocking
                        Goofy out before he can heal Donald. Sora does his best against Cloud, but
                        being a recruit of SOLDIER, his experience is unmatched, and he knocks the
                        wind out of Sora. He walks over to a kneeling Sora, Donald and Goofy
                        unconscious around them, and he peers down at the boy. Phil runs in with a
                        white towel, but Hades stops him. Cloud raises his sword and Sora closes his
                        eyes, bracing himself. Cloud lowers his sword to Sora’s surprise, and he
                        hears footsteps behind him, turning just as a giant black claw crashes down
                        on him. Sora looks up to see an enormous three-headed beast with red eyes
                        growling over him. Darkness emanates from its jaws, each of its razor sharp
                        teeth bared. Sora gasps as Hades retreats into the barracks</desc>
                <sp>

            <speaker>Philoctetes</speaker> Whew, that was close! That was Cerberus, the
                        guardian of the Underworld. Herc should be able to handle him. But then
                        again, maybe not... This doesn’t look good. I hope Herc’s okay. Wish I could
                        go in!</sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I’m not afraid. You can decide if I’m hero material or

                        over his shoulder, Cerberus’s giant jaws bearing down on him, inches away.
                        The beast’s ears perk up, hearing their entrance and they turn around,
                        allowing Hercules to run Cloud to the Lobby, past Phil</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Philoctetes</speaker> Kid, I got two words of advice for you:
                        Attack!</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>Cerberus roars and stomps around the arena, sending large fireballs at Sora,
                        Donald, and Goofy. Sora manages to stay out of the beast’s path, Donald
                        sending Thunder spells at its three heads. One of the fireballs heads Sora’s
                        way, and he deflects it with his Keyblade, hitting the center head square in
                        the eyes. The beast stops, roaring, and attempts to bite him as he attacks.
                        Backing up, Cerberus rears up on its hind legs, and drops to the ground,
                        sending a shockwave to the trio. Sora heals with a Potion as the beast’s
                        mouth foams with dark energy. It moves forward sending dark matter spewing
                        out of its mouth and into the ground. Sora rolls to dodge as the energy
                        pools and shoots up from under him. Goofy, finding a way on top of the
                        beast, sends his shield flying at the multiple heads. Sora moves in as it
                        tries to bite at Goofy and knocks out the beast, which falls to the ground
                        loudly. Later, Hercules and Phil are addressing Sora, Donald, and Goofy in
                        the Lobby. Phil reads from a piece of papyrus as Hercules stands with his
                        arms crossed</desc>

                <desc>Out of the rafters a claw appears. Sora looks up in time to see a leopard
                        pouncing in his direction. Sora leaps up and blocks with his Keyblade. He
                        jumps back as the leopard lands on the wooden floor and knocks Sora away.
                        The leopard roars and tries to claw at him, but he slides away and strikes
                        with his Keyblade, sending it flying across the room. After a tough
                        struggle, it lies on the floor, tricking Sora into coming closer. Suddenly,
                        it leaps up and roars as someone enters through a hole in the ceiling. He
                        spins around the rafters and leaps to the floor. As the leopard pounces at
                        Sora, the man blocks its bite with a spear. The leopard struggles wildly,
                        its jaws clamped around the spear. The man knocks it back, glaring at it,
                        and it snarls before leaping out a window, sending shards of glass flying
                        everywhere. The wild man puts away his spear and addresses Sora. He has long
                        brown dreadlocks and wears a loincloth over his toned body. He stands low,
                        his knuckles touching the ground like an animal</desc>

                        ground. The rustling continues and the two swallow hard in fear as a tall
                        man carrying a rifle enters the thicket. Tarzan jumps from the balcony of
                        the treehouse, crawling over the netting below, and leads Sora down the tree
                        by sliding on its branches. They land at camp, where several tables with

            <speaker>Jane (showing them the projector)</speaker> Why don’t we try this?
                        We’ll show Tarzan some slides and see if any of them match that word. Oh,

            <speaker>Clayton</speaker> Clayton’s the name. I’m a hunter, not a researcher.
                        What? No, I am not trying to hunt the gorillas. But they’re so rare! I’d
                        just like to get a look at them.</sp>

                        now. But we have yet to encounter these friends of yours. I’d wager they’re
                        with the gorillas. But Tarzan refuses to take us to them.</sp>

                        trees. Tarzan finds Kerchak and Kala among the trees, numerous vines hanging
                        around them. Kerchak looks sternly at Sora, Donald, and Goofy as Tarzan
                        pleads his case to them in Mangani</desc>

                        Donald runs to the tree house and screams just as Clayton fires. His aim
                        off, the bullet narrowly misses Terkina, who runs away behind Kerchak. Sora

                <desc>He hears a rustling from the jungle and stops before the pipe reaches his

                        rifle into the jungle as the noise gets closer, and the shot rings out loud
                        and clear. Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Tarzan run outside and see a gorilla
                        surrounded by monkey-like creatures</desc>

        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>They exit the tent and hear a gunshot from the direction of the Bamboo
                        Thicket. They run into the thicket and find Clayton’s pipe on the mound in
                        the center. A shadow leaps over them and Sabor lands, roaring at them, teeth
                        bared. It claws the air towards Sora, but Donald sends a Fire spell at it.
                        Sora strikes it with the Keyblade and it jumps into the tall stalks of
                        bamboo. They wait for it to emerge, Tarzan listening keenly. It leaps out
                        and Tarzan assaults it with his spear, spinning it wildly. Goofy tackles it
                        with his shield and it tries to bite him. They continue attacking it until
                        it slows down, its vision going blurry. Sabor looks up to the sun, falling
                        unconscious, and collapses to the ground, losing a fang in the process.
                        Meanwhile, Terk runs through the campsite past numerous Heartless and into
                        the tent, frightening Jane and knocking her to the ground. Jane looks to see
                        that the gorilla is alright before someone enters the tent. Jane looks up,
                        terrified, and holds Terkina tightly. Sora and company return to camp to
                        find the tent empty</desc>

                        rushes forward, but is knocked back by an invisible creature. It calls out
                        and Clayton mounts it, reloading his rifle and aiming it at them again. Sora
                        attacks the creature, causing it to shed its invisibility. The great green
                        chameleon stares at them through wild spinning eyes. It sends out beams of
                        energy before jumping up to a high ledge, and Donald calls down a Thunder
                        spell, while Tarzan climbs the vines along the wall towards it. He stabs it

                        with a flurry of attacks while Donald casts magic spells. Tarzan faces
                        Clayton and forces him towards the waterfall. He clutches his chest and aims
                        his rifle at them, his eyes staring daggers. The Heartless rises up behind
                        him slowly, sparks crackling around it, cause Clayton to turn around. It
                        begins to fall on him and he screams. A glowing heart bursts from its chest
                        and floats into the air as Clayton and the Heartless disappear. Kala and the
                        other gorillas gather nearby as Kerchak walks up to Sora. He grabs him by
                        the collar of his jacket and tosses him into the air. Sora lands with a thud
                        on the top of the cliff. Donald and Goofy follow suit while Tarzan climbs to
                        meet them. They look down towards the gorillas, who leave. Tarzan crawls

                <sp>
            <speaker>??????????</speaker> The hunter lured them there. It was his lust for
                        power that was the bait. But it seems the bait was too tasty for his own

            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> Leon’s probably at the underground cavern. He trains
                        there often. You know, the channel in the alleyway is connected to the

                <desc>They enter the Alleyway though the Second District and find a grate at the

                        through the channel to where Leon is practicing his battle swing. Aerith is
                        there with him</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> So, you found the Keyhole.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Yeah. The Keyblade locked it automatically.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Good.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Every world among the stars has a Keyhole. And each one
                        leads to the heart of that world. There must be one in this town as
                        well.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What do you mean?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> It was in Ansem’s report.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Leon (crossing his arms)</speaker> The Heartless enter through the
                        Keyhole and do something to the world’s core.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What happens to the world?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> In the end, it disappears.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora, Donald &amp; Goofy</speaker> What!</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> That’s why your key is so important.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Please lock the Keyholes. You’re the only one who
                        can.</sp>
                <sp>

                <sp>

                        don’t know nothin’ about navigation gummis? Bunch of pinheads. Interspace
                        ain’t no playground.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> There’s a lot we don’t know. So what! We have to use the

                <sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> Basically, with navigation gummis, you can go to new

                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What do you need to deliver?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> Just this book. It’s real old. When the guy brought it
                        in, it was practically falling apart. Too beat up to restore it to the way
                        it was. But overall, I did a decent job puttin’ it back together. Anyway,
                        you mind deliverin’ it for me? It’s the old house past the Third District.
                        Look for a big fire sign.</sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> Hmm? The bell at the gizmo shop is ringing. Go check it
                        out if you want, but deliver that book for me first. When you’re done, stop
                        by the house in the Third District. I’ll be there.</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>They leave the shop and enter the Third District, finding the fire sign at the
                        end of an alley. Sora hits it with a Fire spell and the door unlocks. They
                        enter a large cavern where a mystical house sits on a central island.
                        Several stepping stones line the path in the water. Sora jumps on them and
                        they begin to move rhythmically. Timing themselves, they traverse the stones
                        and reach the house. The house looks beaten and worn down despite its
                        festive purple hue. The front entrance way is covered in wooden boards and
                        cloth. They find a broken hole in the side of the brick wall with a green
                        curtain draped over it, and use it to get into the house. They enter an
                        empty space with a raised platform in the center. Sora hears a voice behind
                        him and whirls around</desc>

                        to their respective places in the house. Soon after, the room is entirely

            <speaker>Merlin</speaker> Your king asked me to train you in the art of magic.
                        We can start anytime you like. Let me know when you’re ready to begin the

                        with a pink bow around her neck. She wears her hood over her white hair and
                        holds up a long magic wand. She smiles at them sweetly</desc>

            <speaker>?????</speaker> Hello. I’m the Fairy Godmother. Your king asked me to

            <speaker>Merlin</speaker> Oh, that book... So, Cid asked you to bring this.
                        Thank you. You wish to know what kind of book it is? I don’t even know,
                        myself. In fact, it’s not mine. Somehow it found its way into my bag one
                        day. It was such a curious book, I asked Cid to repair it for me. Well, I
                        guess I’ll put it here somewhere, for now. This book holds a great secret.
                        The missing pages will unlock it.</sp>

                        you like. My best regards to Cid for repairing it for me. Oh, and about that
                        stone of yours... You should ask the Fairy Godmother about that.</sp>

                        this one has such a strong heart, he became a gem instead of vanishing with

                <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> Well, we all lived here in the Hundred Acre Wood. And
                        we’d take walks together, or play Pooh sticks... And every day, I’d eat some
                        honey. Just one small smackeral would taste very good right now.</sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> A witch, man, she’s a witch!</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> She’s the reason this town is full of Heartless. Don’t
                        take her lightly.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> She’s been using the Heartless for years.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> We lost our world, thanks to her.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> One day, a swarm of Heartless took over our world!</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> That was nine years ago.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> I got out of that mess and came here with these

            <speaker>Donald</speaker> That’s awful!</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> Our ruler was a wise man named Ansem. He dedicated his
                        life to studying the Heartless.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> His report should tell us how to get rid of the

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Where’s this report?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> We don’t know. It got scattered when our world was
                        destroyed.</sp>
                <sp>

            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> You see? It’s just as I told you. While you toiled
                        away trying to find your dear friend, he quite simply replaced you with some
                        new companions. Evidently, now he values them far more than he does

                        installed and ready to go. You find another one, you bring it to me. I threw
                        in a warp gummi for the heck of it. Now you can jump to worlds you’ve been
                        to before. Well, better get back to my real job. What’s my real job? You’ll
                        see. See me at the First District.</sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> The one above the gizmo shop. There’s a legend about
                        it, you know.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> But it’s all boarded up. Nobody can get in there.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> Heck, go check it out. Ring it three times to see if
                        anything happens.</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>They leave and enter the Second District, battling Heartless on their way to
                        the roof of the Gizmo Shop. They take down the wooden boards of the bell
                        tower and Sora rings the bell</desc>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>The mural in the fountain in the square below changes and the empty fountain
                        fills with flames. Sora rings it again and the mural changes once more, the
                        fire dissipating and the lights above the fountain blink on. When the bell
                        tolls the third time, the lights shut off and water spurts out of the
                        fountain, the mural changing finally to butterflies surrounding a flower,
                        which then reveals a large Keyhole. They jump down to the square and
                        approach the fountain when the Guard Armor drops from the sky. Sora begins
                        attacking the torso of the Heartless while Donald and Goofy go after its
                        legs. It spins its arms wildly and with a few more hits, it crashes to the
                        ground, motionless. The trio pauses, watching as the armor twitches. It
                        reforms its body and falls forward, its arms digging into the ground. Its
                        torso and legs flip over, and the toes of its hammer- like feet curve
                        inwards, forming hands. Its helmet opens and its yellow eyes stare blankly
                        at them. It lunges forward and meets the blade in Sora’s hands. The Opposite
                        Armor continues to tackle them, floating in midair. The Heartless soon
                        splits itself in half, the helmet and arms going after Sora, and the feet
                        and torso find their targets in Donald and Goofy. Donald summons a Thunder
                        spell, sending bolts of electricity into the armor. The helmet swirls around
                        between the arms, almost taunting them, before its body reforms. It moves to
                        tackle them again, but mid-tackle, Sora strikes, knocking its parts
                        everywhere. Nearly defenseless, they destroy its appendages, leaving just
                        the torso and helmet. It turns its torso sideways, staring at them with its
                        glowing eyes. A ball of energy shoots out from inside it, and it targets
                        Sora, who dodges away. Another ball of energy shoots out, and this time Sora
                        is ready for it. He blocks with his Keyblade, sending the orb back to the
                        Opposite Armor, which begins to shake violently. The helmet falls inside its
                        torso and a large glowing heart floats out into the sky, before the armor
                        disappears. Sora walks over to the shining Keyhole, and locks it. The
                        Keyhole shimmers and breaks off, disintegrating into pieces, leaving only
                        the butterfly mural and a gummi block. Sora, Donald, and Goofy return to the
                        First District and meet Cid behind the Accessory Shop</desc>

                        gained evil powers and seized Agrabah. He’s desperately looking for
                        something— something he calls the <q>Keyhole.</q> Jafar caught me trying to
                        escape, but he helped me.</sp>

                        face. He reels back as Aladdin searches around for Jasmine, who is
                        desperately calling out for help among the clay pots. Several of the

                <desc>They take the Magic Carpet to the Desert. Suddenly, something bursts out of
                        the sand, spinning violently toward them. It lands two giant feet on the
                        ground, clawing at carpet, who dodges frantically as Sora grits his teeth.
                        The four of them topple out of the carpet as Kurt Zisa turns its six-armed
                        body in their direction, summoning two orbs of energy in its hands. The orb
                        cancel their magic summoning abilities and Sora moves in to attack its feet.
                        As it walks closer to them, the mechanical crunch echoing through the
                        desert, it stares at them with its snake-like head. Two of its other arms
                        hold long curved scythes, which is spins wildly, slicing at them. Sora and
                        Aladdin eliminate the magic-cancelling orbs and Donald sends a Thunder
                        spell, sending it falling to the ground. It’s head rears up out of its body
                        on a long elastic neck, attempting to bite them, before it jumps back up,
                        summoning large dust devils, tossing sand everywhere. Goofy charges it with
                        his shield, but misses as it spins through the air toward Sora. Donald heals
                        him as it sends fireballs toward them. With several more critical strikes,
                        Kurt Zisa stumbles forward. They run away from it as its arms crash down in
                        the sand around them. Aladdin summons the Magic Carpet and it swoops down to
                        grab them as the Heartless falls over completely. A large glowing heart
                        rises up into the sky as they fly away towards the end of the desert,
                        watching as the Heartless vanishes in the distance. They reach the sandpit
                        where they found Aladdin earlier and dismount from the carpet. They step
                        forward and the sand in front of them lurches upward. The ground quakes as
                        an enormous tiger head heaves out of the sand. Its mouth opens, heat and
                        flame emanating from its depths, and its eyes glow. An evil glow, one of
                        dark purpose. They approach its mouth before it reels upward, blasting them
                        with a hot torrent of sand. Heartless appear and they realize the tiger head
                        is under their control. Sora begins thrashing at the Heartless before a beam
                        of energy strikes Aladdin in the back, knocking him over. Donald heals him
                        and Sora sees that the beams are coming from its eyes. After he destroys a
                        few Heartless, the tiger head buries its mouth in the sand, and Sora jumps
                        onto its nose, because it releases a spray of sand from its mouth. Sora
                        attacks its eyes before a Bandit Heartless flips onto the top of the tiger,
                        almost knocking Sora off. Goofy climbs up the side of the tiger head and
                        shields Sora from more flying Heartless. Sora continues striking the eyes
                        until the power of darkness is driven from the Cave of Wonders. Once
                        everything settles down, they enter the cave. Fighting Heartless through the
                        labyrinthine halls of the Cave of Wonders, they drop down to a watery level
                        and Sora destroys a pillar with a Fire spell. Meanwhile, in the Lamp
                        Chamber, Jafar stands next to an enslaved Genie as Jasmine lies unconscious
                        on the stone floor. Jafar taps his snake staff on the ground and holds up
                        the magic lamp</desc>

                        Donald, Goofy, and Aladdin make their way past the Treasure Room and into
                        the Lamp Chamber, where they find Jafar speaking with Maleficent</desc>

                        chanting a spell and he sends a beam of heat from his staff at them. Aladdin
                        runs forward and attacks Jafar, who teleports to a platform on the other
                        edge of the room as Genie floats toward them</desc>

                        up and begins thrashing with his Keyblade, causing Genie to cheer. Jafar
                        chants another spell, causing a giant hailstorm in the center of the room,
                        trapping Donald and Goofy. Aladdin strikes from behind while Jafar is
                        distracted and the vizier pulses with energy. Lightning crackles around him
                        and he screams. Aladdin runs over to Jasmine, but before he can reach her,
                        Jafar gets an idea</desc>

                <desc>Genie covers his eyes and looks away, pointing his finger at Jafar and
                        releasing as small amount of wish energy as possible. It strikes Jafar, who
                        begins to glow and the floor crumbles beneath him, revealing a large pool of
                        lava surrounding stone platforms. Jafar descends towards the pool and they
                        stare down into the frightening, gaping maw. They jump down into the cavern,
                        searching around for Jafar, when suddenly he bursts out of the lava with a
                        great laugh. He gazes down at them evilly in his red genie form, brimming
                        with power and malice. Iago flies by them, holding a coal black lamp</desc>

                        at him, but he shrugs it off</desc>

                        her. She turns around slowly and is taken. The magic carpet brings Sora,
                        Donald, Goofy, and Aladdin back to the Keyhole, but Jasmine is nowhere to be

                <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Good day, Pooh. What are you doing? Using a balloon to
                        get some honey? Splendid idea! Allow me to offer a few pointers.</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>He flies to a higher branch</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Ahem! Now, Pooh can get honey by floating up this tree
                        with his balloon. The honey is inside the tree hollows, not the beehives you
                        see here.</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>He flies to an even higher branch</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> There’s quite a lot of honey in these holes. If Pooh gets
                        too close, the bees will come out to protect their honey. If they get to
                        Pooh, they’ll pop his balloon. Lock onto the bees and swat them away. The
                        more time Pooh has at each hollow, the more honey he can eat. There’s more
                        honey higher up, too. If jumping from branch to branch proves difficult, try
                        the Rush command. Rush can help you catch up to Pooh quickly. But it isn’t
                        fully reliable. Good luck.</sp>

                        balance, and spits out Pinocchio into a hole in the floor. Riku jumps in
                        after him as the Heartless escapes. The water level in the mouth decreases

                <desc>Jiminy jumps happily. Sora looks over to Donald and Goofy. Riku thinks for a
                        second before looking up suddenly as the Parasite Cage falls from a hole in
                        the ceiling. Riku makes a quick exit through a corridor of darkness, leaving
                        them alone with the Heartless. Pinocchio runs out of the stomach and the
                        Parasite Cage picks itself up on its arms and swings itself at Sora and
                        company. Donald yells and sends a Thunder spell at it, while Sora runs up to
                        it and begins striking its body with the Keyblade. The Parasite Cage begins
                        swinging its arms again, but Goofy slams his shield into them, causing the
                        Heartless to reel back. The top head falls backwards, causing the cage to
                        open. It lies there, unconscious, while Sora continues to deal damage to it.
                        It straightens up and begins swinging its arms again, knocking out Donald.
                        The Heartless places its arms into the stomach acid, sucking it up through
                        its appendages, and blowing it out through its mouth. Sora falls in pain
                        Goofy falls unconscious. While the Parasite Cage continues swinging its arms
                        madly, Sora uses Cure on both Donald and Goofy and the three of them move in
                        unison. With a few more strikes, it flies backwards, a glowing heart coming
                        out of its cage- like mouth and floating away. It begins to fall over,
                        splashing acid everywhere</desc>

            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Simply get to the carrots before Tigger lands on them.
                        There are fifteen carrots here. Your score depends on how many you save, and
                        how many times you block Tigger. Oh, and one more thing.</sp>

                        while near a carrot that isn’t buried yet. You’ll dash to the target area
                        before Tigger lands. Well, good luck!</sp>

                        to swim properly. Practice swimming with Flounder. Try to tag him. All

                        a Sunken Ship. They enter the ship and an ominous shape swims in the waters
                        above. Once they reach a stateroom inside the sunken ship a huge shark
                        crashes through the window, attempting to bite them. It is unable to swim
                        inside the shape due to its size, so it swims away and waits for them to
                        leave. Inside the ship they find a crystal trident inside a treasure

                <desc>They return to the Sunken Ship area and find a large stone with the marking of

                        They enter the Den of Tides and follow it to Ursula’s Lair. Ursula crawls

                <desc>She spits out disorienting bubbles at them, which stop them for a second, but
                        they swim straight at her and begin pummeling away. Suddenly, the current
                        changes and Sora feels himself being swept upward towards her mouth. He
                        swims away frantically as Ariel and Donald attack from behind. He manages to
                        get away just as she bites down</desc>

                <desc>She summons an energy beam which she aims at Sora, who begins swimming around
                        her to dodge it, but she continues circling, unwilling to let him escape.
                        She catches her breath after the intense beam leaves her defenseless. Donald
                        and Ariel continue attacking her head while Goofy goes for her hand, which
                        is still clutching the trident. She gathers strength again and lifts the
                        trident high</desc>

                <desc>Several lightning bolts attack the water around them, almost knocking them all
                        out. Ursula, at her wit’s end, begins inhaling water, dragging Sora toward
                        her. Instead of swimming away, he uses this to propel himself toward her and
                        tackles her with the Keyblade right into her throat. She tries to scream,
                        holding her hands to her throat as the water around her crackles with
                        energy. She begins flailing and disappears in a flurry of darkness, leaving
                        only the trident floating in a beam of light. They return to the Throne Room
                        and speak to King Triton</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Daddy, I’m so sorry.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Please don’t be angry with her.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> It’s my fault. You followed Ursula because... I
                        wouldn’t let you follow your heart. And when you found that crystal, I lost
                        my temper and destroyed it.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Oh, yeah, the crystal! Why did you destroy it?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> The crystal held the power to reveal the Keyhole. The
                        Keyhole is dangerous. I had to keep you away from it at any cost.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Daddy...</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> Key bearer, I have one more request: Seal the Keyhole.
                        My trident also holds the power to reveal the Keyhole. Will you do it?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Of course. That’s what we had in mind from the
                        start.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Where is the Keyhole, Daddy?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Triton</speaker> You should know better than anyone. It’s in your
                        grotto.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Really... Sora, let’s go.</sp>

                <desc>They return to Ariel’s Grotto and Ariel uses the trident to reveal the

                <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel</speaker> Tell me, Sora. Your world, what’s it like?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Oh, about that... Sorry for lying to you.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Ariel (smiling)</speaker> It’s okay. Besides, if you can travel to
                        other worlds, maybe I can, too.</sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Sebastian (sighing)</speaker> Well, if you find it, do me a favor and

                        this time. It’s not much of a tail, though I’m sort of attached to it. But I
                        don’t know why anybody’d look for it. Probably won’t find it anyway...</sp>
                <sp>

                        it!</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Owl, can you fly up high and help us find Eeyore’s
                        tail?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Sorry, but my eyes aren’t what they used to be. Too much
                        reading, you know. But I can offer good advice! Of course, you don’t have to
                        if you don’t want to. See that swing up there? Take Pooh there.</sp>

            <speaker>Owl</speaker> You’re a bit too big for the swing, but Pooh should fit
                        nicely. I’ll tell you more when you get there.</sp>

            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Here’s what to do. First, get ready to push.</sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Owl</speaker> Not bad, not bad! Here’s the next step. If you time it
                        right, Pooh will swing higher and higher. Try it! Push too soon, Pooh won’t
                        go any higher. Push too late, he’ll go too high.</sp>

                        Rabbit on a house made of sticks, knocking Eeyore over. Pooh stands up and
                        Eeyore sees something under the pile of sticks</desc>

                        naught but a skull; behind his eyes, only blackness. He strikes a pose and

            <speaker>Sally</speaker> I have a bad feeling about this. If only Jack would
                        reconsider... I’m happy if he’s happy, but I’m just so worried about him.
                        I’m worried about him because I...well, I just am. Jack, why not have these
                        kids star in the festival instead? They both look rather frightful. And
                        funny, too. They’d be better than the Heartless.</sp>

                        and raises his Keyblade, which lights up and a bubble drops down from above.
                        The bubble pops, revealing a young elephant with enormous ears. Sora jumps
                        onto Dumbo, grabbing onto the elephant’s hat. Dumbo flies into the air with
                        his huge ears and sprays a torrent of water at Oogie Boogie. Once the
                        boogeyman has had enough of this, he activates an explosion. Dumbo
                        disappears and Sora is sent back into the pit. Donald attempts to strike

                        budged an inch.</sp>

                <desc>Sora can see part of Kairi’s leg through the grate. Her arm falls next to her
                        with the movement of the ship. He holds out a hand with a sad, but hopeful
                        face. Wendy stands up and grabs hold of a dresser. Kairi’s fingers twitch,
                        putting a smile on Sora’s face. The door opens and Kairi is dragged away.
                        Wendy cries out as she is taken away and the door shuts</desc>

                        Peter Pan bangs on the locked door</desc>

        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>They enter another door into a room with a ladder. They climb up to the
                        Captain’s Hold. Sora runs ahead and sees Riku</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Riku, wait!</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>Riku holds Kairi in his arms as a shadow flows in from under the door behind
                        him. Riku backs away towards the door and the shadow leaps out of the floor.
                        It looks just like Sora, staring eerily with glowing eyes. Riku escapes and
                        the shadow crawls along the floor underfoot. Jumping up at Sora, striking
                        him with a dark duplicate of the Keyblade. It moves like Sora, attacking and
                        deflecting blows just the same. Sora goes after it, but it sinks back into
                        the floor, splitting into three copies. The room crowded, Peter Pan flies
                        forward striking them with his shadow and giving a loud crow. He destroys
                        two of the shadows, leaving the real one at the mercy of his blade. Antisora
                        vanishes into a burst of darkness and turns invisible. Catching Sora
                        offguard, he swipes at him in the air, visible for only a second, before
                        disappearing. Antisora makes no sound due to its status as a shadow, so they
                        don’t have the help of following its footfalls. Donald attempts to bring it
                        out with Thunder spells, but it wears him out and comes up empty. It strikes
                        at Peter Pan, but Goofy’s shield blocks it. Sora uses Strike Raid, tossing
                        his Keyblade through the room. It flies through the air, spinning wildly
                        until it makes contact with Antisora, who freezes on the spot, it’s darkness
                        dripping to the floor. It stands there motionless like a statue before
                        falling into the dark pool. Sora’s shadow returns to him and they drop down
                        through the floor into Wendy’s room. They find her laying on the floor with
                        her eyes closed. Peter Pan floats down next to her and picks her head
                        up</desc>

        <cutscene>

                        sharp-toothed crocodile in the water, the clock inside its belly ticking
                        away</desc>

                <desc>Sora closes his eyes and leaps backwards off the plank. He descends toward the

                        the deck. Peter Pan swoops down and takes Tinker Bell from Smee, who is
                        distracted by Sora. Sora and Peter Pan land on the deck in front of the
                        flabbergasted first mate. Peter Pan opens the lantern, setting Tinker Bell
                        free</desc>

                <desc>They start attacking the Heartless on the ship and in the air. Sora holds a
                        hand to his chest and the Keyblade flashes. He throws it into the air and
                        catches it. Magic sparks burst out of the tip of the blade uncontrollably
                        and he loses his grip on it. In a final burst of magic, it creates blue
                        smoke which billows upward. Genie appears inside the smoke with a huge grin
                        on his face. He yells and flexes his muscles, spinning around and giving
                        Sora a high five. Genie targets the surrounding Heartless and shoots them
                        with several magic spells</desc>

                <desc>Sora slides towards him and attempts to strike with the Keyblade, but Hook
                        jumps back near the rudder. Sora flies up and after him. He sends a Fira
                        spell at the Captain, which sets his trousers on fire, causing him to run
                        around hysterically. He runs over the guardrail of the top deck, and Peter
                        Pan knocks him into the water, making a big splash. He surfaces in front of
                        the crocodile, who opens his mouth happily, his tongue lolling about as he
                        pounces at Captain Hook. The captain runs on the water, screaming, as the
                        crocodile chases him out of sight. Later, Sora stands at the guardrail away

        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>They fly off the ship away from Never Land to a quaint city where the moon is
                        shining brightly over the large clock tower. The tower has four faces, a
                        clock on each side. As they approach, a cloaked Heartless flies alongside
                        them. Sora looks over and it stares at him beneath its hood, darkness
                        trailing in the air behind it. They stop and it faces them in front of the
                        tower, gathering magic in its fingers. The numbers of the clock start to
                        glow and the minute hand begins to move forward. Donald sees this and
                        quickly casts stop on the clock. The Phantom Heartless swoops forward and
                        attempts to claw at Sora with its sharp fingers. A bright orb of magical
                        energy appears at the base of the Heartless’s cloak. Sora strikes it with
                        his Keyblade and it turned red in color. Donald shoots a Fira spell at it
                        and it turns blue. Smiling, Donald aims a Blizzara spell, and the orb
                        disappears. The Phantom recoils, enraged. It spins around and releases a
                        dark fireball. Sora tries to fly away but it strikes him in the back. Goofy
                        tosses him a Potion and they continue their magic strategy until the Phantom
                        begins to falter in the air. Its hands cover its stomach, bending over in
                        front of the clock. From beneath its cloak, a heart floats out, and the
                        Phantom falls and fades away. Wendy sits at the clock tower as they fly
                        towards her. She stands up as they land. Soon, the clock strikes midnight
                        and the Keyhole appears, shining bright enough to be seen from a distance,
                        flashing between the 2 and 3 on the clock. Sora aims his Keyblade at it and
                        locks it. It glows and disappears, releasing a gummi block. Meanwhile in
                        Hollow Bastion, Riku’s memories flash through his mind. He recalls the day
                        nearly 9 years ago when he and Sora discovered the Secret Place</desc>

                        know the new girl at the mayor’s house? She arrived on the night of the
                        meteor shower!</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>Sora exits the cave, and Riku follows him, before stopping to look back at the
                        wooden door. A golden Keyhole has appeared on the door and he stares at it
                        in fascination. Riku snaps back into reality, a light from the ceiling
                        casting its glow on him. He is kneeling on the floor, entirely out of
                        breath. He breathes heavily as green torches burn on the walls. Maleficent
                        stands over him, holding her staff strongly, looking down on him with
                        dominating eyes</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent (deriding)</speaker> It was reckless to bring her here
                        without at least using a vessel. Remember, relying too heavily on the dark
                        powers could cost you your heart.</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>A booming roar resounds from outside the castle, causing Riku to stand and
                        look toward the source of the noise. Maleficent smiles</desc>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Though his world perished, his heart did not. When
                        we took the princess from his castle, he apparently followed her here
                        through sheer force of will. But fear not. No harm will come to you. He is
                        no match for your power.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> My power?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Yes, the untapped power that lies within you. Now,
                        child, it’s time you awakened that power and realized your true
                        potential.</sp>

                        spinning angry circles around them. Then she does the same to Sora</desc>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Geppetto</speaker> A man named Leon helped us. He even got us this
                        house to live in. I don’t know how I’ll ever repay his kindness. Say, I hear
                        you three are fighting the Heartless. I thought I might be able to help you,

                <sp>
            <speaker>Goofy</speaker> The king told us to go out and find the key bearer, and

                        bookshelves and stained glass windows. He floats in the air, watching</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Where am I?</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>He sees an old woman sitting on a chair under a long staircase. A young girl
                        with red hair runs up to the woman, who smiles down at her</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Grandmother</speaker> Long ago, people lived in peace, bathed in the
                        warmth of light. Everyone loved the light. Then people began to fight over
                        it. They wanted to keep it for themselves. And darkness was born in their
                        hearts. The darkness spread, swallowing the light and many people’s hearts.
                        It covered everything, and the world disappeared. But small fragments of
                        light survived...in the hearts of children. With these fragments of light,
                        children rebuilt the lost world. It’s the world we live in now. But the true
                        light sleeps, deep within the darkness. That’s why the worlds are still
                        scattered, divided from each other. But someday, a door to the innermost
                        darkness will open. And the true light will return. So, listen, child. Even
                        in the deepest darkness, there will always be a light to guide you. Believe
                        in the light, and the darkness will never defeat you. Your heart will shine
                        with its power and push the darkness away. Do you understand, Kairi?</sp>

            <speaker>Beast</speaker> I simply believed. Nothing more to it. When our world

                <desc>The beast roars and leaps up at Riku. It swipes at him with its sharp claws,
                        but Riku flips backward, dodging the attack completely. The beast’s cloak
                        settles to his side as Riku lands on his feet. With lightning speed, Riku
                        charges forward at the beast. Sora arrives in time to see the beast fall to
                        the ground with a stinging growl</desc>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> So, you finally made it. About time. I’ve been waiting
                        for you. We’ve always been rivals, haven’t we? You’ve always pushed me as
                        I’ve always pushed you.</sp>
                <sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> But it all ends here. There can’t be two Keyblade

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> What are you talking about?</sp>

                <desc>He extends his hand out toward the Keyblade, which begins to shake violently
                        in Sora’s grasp. Sora grabs the blade with two hands as it starts to pull
                        itself toward Riku. The Keyblade flashes out of Sora’s hands...</desc>
                <sp>

            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Maleficent was right. You don’t have what it takes to

                        Sora falls to his hands and knees in defeat as Riku leaves. Donald and Goofy

        </cutscene>

                <desc>They continue after Riku. Sora doesn’t move, feeling the cold stone beneath
                        his fingers and the spray of the water on his clothes. He is nearly deaf to
                        the low growl and thumping footsteps behind him. He looks up, seeing the
                        beast walk past him. He watches as it falls to the ground again with a moan.
                        Sora gets up and runs to his side</desc>
                <sp>

        <cutscene>
                <desc>He looks up at the castle and stands up again. He starts slowly walking

                <sp>
            <speaker>Beast</speaker> And though I am on my own, I will fight. I won’t leave

        <cutscene>
                <desc>Sora turns around, staring at the wooden sword on the ground. He picks it up
                        and walks back to the Beast’s side</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Me too. I’m not gonna give up now. I came here to find
                        someone very important to me.</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>They make their way up to the furthest platform and gaze at Hollow Bastion.
                        Mysterious gases swirl from pipes protruding from the castle. The center of
                        its towers displays a large Heartless emblem, shattered from the inside, the
                        gears clearly visible from the platform. Mechanical cranes are built into
                        all sides of the castle, though are largely rusted and overgrown, as if the
                        innards of the castle themselves came alive and rooted themselves deeply
                        across its façade. The rest of the world below has become a barren
                        crystalline wasteland and darkness waits at every corner. A switch activates
                        and a pink light appears at the castle. A magical line appears toward them,
                        bringing a metal platform with it, rigged to the line with electric sparks.
                        Sora and the Beast walk onto the elevator, which takes them up to Hollow
                        Bastion. Finding the castle gates locked, they descend into the watery
                        underbelly of the fortress, finding the access switch in the confusing maze
                        of the dungeons. They release the switch, and the gears in the wall begin to
                        spin and they hear the sound of a door opening. Heading back to the castle
                        gates, they enter the main Hall. Meanwhile in the Grand Hall, Jasmine,
                        Alice, and the other princesses of heart are encased in crystal chambers on
                        the sides of the room under the effects of a sleeping curse. Maleficent
                        walks over an ornate carpet bearing the Heartless insignia toward a large
                        open room, each footfall echoing in the vacant hall. Kairi’s body rests in a
                        dark capsule in the center of the room. Maleficent’s fingers curl around her
                        staff as she passes the capsule and ascends the stairs. She whirls around to
                        face the princesses of heart</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> O purest of hearts! Reveal to me the Keyhole!</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>She raises her arms fervently. The hearts of the six maidens lining the walls
                        glow in unison and beams of pink light shine out from them. The six meet at
                        a point in the air over Kairi’s body, pointing a trail of sparkles to a
                        great heart in the room beyond. Maleficent watches, and smiles. Meanwhile,
                        Sora and Beast arrive in the Entrance Hall, seeing no one</desc>

            <speaker>Beast</speaker> Be on your guard. They’re close, I can feel it. Are you

                <desc>He whirls around, seeing the faint shape of a woman in a golden dress in the
                        dark doorway. It erupts into a cloud of darkness, where a Shadow Heartless
                        appears. The Beast shakes, rage and frustration flowing within him. He gives
                        out a great roar and charges after the Heartless, the door closing in on
                        him, separating him from Sora. The sound echoes in Sora’s ears</desc>

                <desc>Tendrils of darkness erupt around Riku and his clothes take on a darker
                        quality. He clenches his fists, feeling the dark powers inside his heart,
                        and glares at who he used to call a friend</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> You’re wrong, Riku. The darkness may destroy my body,

                <desc>He thrusts his hand forward, releasing a dark fireball aimed straight at

                        ripple, his hair whipping across his face. Sora is paralyzed as it draws
                        near him and he closes his eyes, hearing a crash</desc>

            <speaker>Sora</speaker> All though my heart may be weak, it’s not alone. It’s
                        grown with each new experience, and it’s found a home with all the friends
                        I’ve made. I’ve become a part of their heart just as they’ve become a part
                        of mine. And if they think of me now and then...if they don’t forget

                <desc>The Keyblade flashes in Riku’s hand, much to his surprise. It disappears and
                        he stares at his hand, gasping in total astonishment. The Keyblade reappears
                        in Sora’s hands, and he stares down at Riku, who takes out Soul Eater, his
                        winged sword. Riku rushes forward attacking Sora in a flourish of hits. Sora
                        dodges sideways and spins around, sliding back toward Riku and striking with
                        his Keyblade. He reels back, landing on his right foot. Bending his knee, he
                        pushes off and jumps into the air over Goofy. Riku lands back on the floor
                        and strikes through Donald, knocking him out. He sends all his frustration
                        into his sword as he slashes at Sora, who holds his Keyblade in two hands,
                        blocking Riku’s blows. Seeing a free opportunity, he bashes Riku in the side
                        with the blade, sending him flying backward toward the fountain in the

            <speaker>?????</speaker> You showed no fear in stepping through the door to
                        darkness. It held no terror for you. Plunge deeper into the darkness, and
                        your heart will grow even stronger.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> What should I do?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> It’s really quite simple. Open yourself to the
                        darkness. That is all. Let your heart, your being become darkness
                        itself.</sp>

                        approach the Castle Chapel, Maleficent stands in the Grand Hall, gazing into
                        the Dark Depths where the Keyhole lays in wait. Riku, in his dark clothing,
                        walks to join her. He speaks, his voice taking on an eerie quality</desc>

            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> What do I care? The darkness holds no power over

                        it sails across the room. The top of her staff sparks with green fire and
                        she lifts it into the air, cackling</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Now you’ll know the meaning of fear! A bolt of

                        The wind whips through Sora’s hair as they attempt to dodge the unending
                        shower of rocks. Goofy covers himself with his shield as Beast is struck
                        down by a meteor. Donald jumps away, but is sideswiped by another. As the
                        witch cackles evilly, Sora stands his ground, placing a hand over his
                        heart</desc>

                        and touches his nose, healing him. He smiles as she twirls around him. Tink
                        flies to Beast and heals him as Maleficent narrows her eyes</desc>

                        Maleficent raises her platform again, knocking Sora and Goofy off, floating
                        to the other end of the room. Sora takes out the Heartless as Donald strikes
                        the platform with another Gravira spell. Sora slides toward Maleficent and
                        attacks her</desc>

                        about to summon another meteor shower, Beast lunges at her, claws

                <desc>She bends over, her breath coming short. A portal appears behind her and she

                        chest, using her staff for balance. Her breath came in tight as a corridor
                        of darkness appeared behind where she tread. Riku steps out of it, the dark

        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>She erupts in green flames, sending them billowing higher into the air, her
                        dark shadow etched in its smoky tendrils as her form changes. She grows
                        larger, her black cloak expanding outward and filling with green. From her
                        back, large wings push outward splitting to her sides, knocking the green
                        from her body into sparks. The black wings connect with gray translucent
                        skin to a large black body, heavily muscled and scaled. The dragon rears
                        back on its hind legs and slams the ground, eyes and mouth a blazing yellow.
                        Donald sends a Blizzara spell at the dragon, who brushes it off like
                        nothing. Sora goes after the head as Beast charges forward, his roars
                        echoing off the stone walls</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Beast</speaker> Step aside!</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>His claws dig into the dragon’s flesh. The dragon screeches and spins,
                        knocking them all back with her tail. The dragon’s mouth foams with green
                        flame and it spew fire from its mouth, setting the room ablaze. Goofy throws
                        his shield at her, but it only enrages the monster further. Donald continues
                        shooting Blizzara spells to try to dampen the fire, while Sora searches for
                        a way over the flames. He whirls around, his eyes settling on the thick
                        vines lining the walls and starts climbing. The dragons screeches, Beast
                        having made it angry enough. It rears back on its hind legs, conjuring fire
                        at the base of its neck. The fireballs fly through the air towards Sora.
                        Finding the highest point of the vines, Sora sees the fireballs coming at
                        him. He sends a Blizzara spell, but it only takes out half of them. Donald
                        sees this and conjures an Aero spell around Sora, protecting him from the
                        rest of the fire. As Beast distracts the dragon, Sora kicks off the wall
                        spiraling towards the creature. He spins and his Keyblade collides with the
                        dragon, who thrashes in pain before crashing to the floor, sending ashes
                        into the air. The thorny vines surrounding the room burst into green flame
                        and disappear as Maleficent leaves nothing but her torn cloak behind. Riku
                        walks over it</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> How ironic. She was just another puppet after all.</sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> The Heartless were using Maleficent from the beginning.
                        She failed to notice the darkness in her heart eating away at her. A fitting

        <cutscene>
                <desc>He grounds his foot into the floor and the cloak disappears. He backs away
                        into a corridor of darkness. Sora finds a summon gem and they return to the
                        Castle Chapel, where a hidden entrance appears. They follow it to the Grand
                        Hall, where they see the princesses encapsulated. They run up the stairs to
                        the main area in front of the great heart, where Kairi sleeps. A barrier
                        prevents Beast and Goofy’s entry, to Donald’s surprise</desc>

                        have been freed. Don’t worry, Sora. If anyone can save your friend, you
                        can.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> Not sure why, but the Heartless are getting stronger.
                        New types of Heartless are popping up all over the place! If anything
                        happens to us, I know we can count on you, Sora.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> Even in your Heartless form, I knew it was you.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> I thought the Keyhole would strength the darkness. I
                        mean the darkness is strong, but still... It’s almost as if someone is
                        holding the darkness back.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> It seems the other princesses have been freed as well.
                        Jasmine apparently hasn’t returned to Agrabah. I suspect the others are
                        still in the castle, too.</sp>

            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Do you remember seeing a man with spiky hair at the
                        coliseum?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Yup.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> I wonder if he’s still searching for his friend? Sora.
                        If you see him, please tell him to be careful. He’s not that friendly, but
                        we all care about him dearly.</sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> I don’t think I can let you do that, kid. The Heartless
                        there are multiplying by the minute. They’d eat your ship up.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Then what can we do?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> Simple. Go around ‘em instead of through. Install a new
                        navigation gummi and take a new route.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> A new gummi? From where?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Cid</speaker> The secret waterway. When I came here 9 years ago, I
                        stored it there in case I ever needed it. Never thought a kid would be the
                        one to use it!</sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> I was lost in the darkness. I couldn’t find my way. As I
                        stumbled through the dark, I started forgetting things—my friends, who I
                        was. The darkness almost swallowed me. But then I heard a voice—your voice.
                        You brought me back.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Kairi</speaker> I didn’t want to just forget about you, Sora. I
                        couldn’t.</sp>

                        darkness. I saw that light. I think that’s what saved me. No matter how deep
                        the darkness, a light shines within. I guess it’s more than just a fairy
                        tale.</sp>
                <sp>

                <sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>?????</speaker> Your heart won the battle against the darkness, but it
                        was too late for your body. That’s why you’re here—in this place of darkness
                        where hearts are gathered.</sp>

                        can’t enter. It has to be closed from both sides. To do this, you need two
                        keys and two hearts. Maybe you’re here for the same reason I am. Maybe it
                        was fate.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Riku</speaker> Fate, huh? You seem to know everything, don’t you? Then

                        Hades regains consciousness. Hades is sent flying back into the hypogeum. He

                <desc>The gates of the hypogeum clamp shut as roars are heard from beyond. Later,
                        the final match of the Hades Cup begins as a large stone creature, the Rock
                        Titan, smashes into the arena. Its two heads look down on them with one
                        objective. It moves toward Sora, Donald, and Goofy, towering over them,
                        sending shockwaves through the arena floor. Sora sends his Keyblade through
                        the air, attacking the titan’s feet. Eventually, it falls on its back, its
                        heads vulnerable to attack. Sora climbs on top of the titan and strikes them
                        with Graviga spells. They try to swing at him and he dodges backward. The
                        Rock Titan stands back up, lifting its arms. It slams them down into the
                        ground, creating an enormous shockwave through the earth. Sora stumbles
                        under the titan as it lifts its strong rocky leg</desc>

        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>Donald sends a Cura spell, healing Sora, and Goofy charges forward at full
                        speed, knocking Sora out of the way of the titan’s foot as it came crashing
                        down. Goofy falls unconscious as the Rock Titan roars into the air. Sora
                        glares at the creature and feels energy welling up inside him. He strikes
                        its leg, knocking it over once again as Donald pulls Goofy to safety. Sora
                        jumps on top of it and sends out a flurry of attacks until the Rock Titan
                        crumbles. Sora covers his eyes as dust blows everywhere as Goofy is healed.
                        Sora looks around, hearing a rumbling sound as the air grows cold. A large
                        icy hand smashes onto the wall of the arena, shortly followed by another,
                        before the towering Ice Titan rears its ugly head over the wall. Sora backs
                        away slowly and the titan slams its foot down onto the floor of the arena,
                        spreading its icy power along the floor. It roars at them, staring at them
                        through emotionless eyes, blowing icy wind through the air. It begins
                        shooting ice shards at the group, causing Donald to send back Fira spells.
                        Goofy deflects the ice with his shield, forcing the titan to fall to its
                        knees. Sora moves in and delivers a string of blows to the titan’s head. It
                        roars again and sends a flurry of ice shards at everyone. Donald casts
                        Aerora on the group and Sora sends Fira spells at the monster. It hisses as
                        the ice shards expand larger when hitting the shields of wind surrounding
                        them. An icy mist surrounds Sora and before he could move, he was frozen on
                        the spot. The Ice Titan stomps on the ground, moving closer to him, sending
                        shockwaves through its feet</desc>

        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>He sends a Fira spell at Sora, breaking him out of the ice in time to slam his
                        Keyblade into the foot of the Ice Titan. It clamps its hands onto its head,
                        slowly shrinking, surrounded by a dense cold air. It punches its foot into
                        the ground, but its leg breaks and the ice in the ground dissipates. It
                        stares confused, hearing a set of rumbling sounds. It looks up, seeing Sora
                        towering over him, and reels back in fear. Sora moves to step on it, but it
                        falls over just in time to miss his giant foot. The creature runs away,
                        trailing dust, and jumps through the gate at the end of the arena. The three
                        celebrate as Hades grumbles behind the gate of the hypogeum. Donald jumps
                        up, sending a Blizzaga spell at Hades’s hair, blowing out the flame much to
                        the god’s surprise. Sora holds the Hades Cup trophy and looks over to a
                        smiling Hercules as Phil laughs proudly. Later, they travel back to Hollow
                        Bastion by a new route and disembark at the Rising Falls, where Beast waits

                <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> We came in Cid’s ship.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> This is our childhood home. We wanted to see it

                <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> It’s in worse shape than I feared. It used to be so

                <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Don’t worry. If we defeat Ansem, all should be

                <sp>
            <speaker>Aerith</speaker> Because every world was isolated. Impassable walls
                        divided them.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> The Heartless destroyed those walls. But if the worlds

            <speaker>Aurora</speaker> It’s the heart of the darkness. It must be where Ansem

                <sp>
            <speaker>Alice</speaker> The darkness still lingers, so we’ll stay as well.
                        Otherwise, this world will be destroyed, too. We’ll do all we can. You

                        keep this world from being taken, too. I just want everything back as it was
                        before.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Jasmine</speaker> Please don’t tell Aladdin about all this. He will
                        worry to death if you do! I will tell him about it, once I return to

                        darkness. It was believed he died defending people from the Heartless. But
                        Ansem was the one who brought them here. Ansem waits in darkness. But here’s
                        a little light to protect you, Sora.</sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> Ansem and Maleficent were both possessed by darkness.
                        You know, I just don’t get it. What’s so great about the darkness?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> This was once Ansem’s castle. He was widely respected as
                        a wise man. But darkness took him. He began experimenting with people’s
                        hearts. Heh, some wise man. So much suffering and ruin, and for what?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> This is my home, but it just doesn’t feel like it. I
                        don’t remember much, ‘cause I was only a kid.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> We thought this was Maleficent’s doing. But she was just
                        another puppet of the darkness. Just like Ansem. This darkness is our real
                        enemy. But how to beat it? Well, first things first. Let’s purge every last
                        Heartless we can find.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Yuffie</speaker> There are no Heartless here, so rest up. We’ve gotta
                        get rid of the Heartless and rebuild this world.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Leon</speaker> I won’t use my real name until this world is
                        restored.</sp>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Belle</speaker> Ansem desires the darkness. He thinks it’s the source
                        of all power. What nonsense. Darkness may shroud light, but it can never
                        extinguish it. Sora, don’t succumb to the darkness. You and the Keyblade can
                        defeat it.</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>Sora, Donald, and Goofy return to the Olympus Coliseum, where a special enemy
                        has appeared. Sora runs into the arena, looking around. A large portal
                        appears in the sky, sending a beam down to the ground. Through the
                        brightness, Sora could see a man with long silver hair. The man stands up
                        slowly, a wing protruding from right side of his back. He stretches out his
                        arm and the wing follows suit. Sora stares as Sephiroth faces him, smiling
                        through sinister eyes. He slowly places a hand on the elongated nodachi
                        sheathed at his hip. He stands far from Sora, but as he unsheathes the
                        sword, he strikes Sora from afar. Sora rushes him and attacks, before
                        dodging away as the man’s range overtakes him. Sephiroth conjures pillars of
                        flame around him, but Sora jumps away nearly scorched. Dozens of dark orbs
                        surround the man, making it harder for Sora to strike at him. He sends a
                        Firaga spell, taking out some of them, before sending down lightning bolts
                        with Thundaga. Sephiroth leaps into the air and slashes at Sora in quick
                        succession. He lands on the ground and glows with a white aura as several
                        meteors crash down from the sky around him. Sora concentrates and flies into
                        the air as the meteors orbit around the man. Sora stays in the air out of
                        the way of the rocks. A black hole spins above Sephiroth’s head, absorbing
                        the meteors and the man begins teleporting around striking Sora and
                        retreating. While a good distance away from Sora, Sephiroth floats into the
                        air chanting, but before he finishes, Sora tosses his Keyblade at him,
                        knocking him to the ground. He stumbles back, clutching his stomach. He
                        stares at Sora and floats into the air. He stretches out his arms as a light
                        erupts from him. The air around him ripples and the mysterious man
                        disappears. Later, Cloud walks into the Coliseum arena with his buster sword
                        out, a serious look on his face. He stops, seeing a blue feather fall from
                        the sky. As the feather lands, Cloud looks up, his eyes making contact with
                        Sephiroth. They stare each other down, neither making a move</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Cloud</speaker> I’ve been looking for you.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sephiroth</speaker> As have I.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Cloud</speaker> As long as you exist, I’ll never wake from this
                        nightmare. You’re my darkness.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sephiroth (extending his arms)</speaker> I’m a part of you, am I? Then
                        join me in this eternal nightmare untarnished by light.</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>Cloud brandishes his sword and Sephiroth closes his eyes, slowly grasping his
                        blade. The tension in the air rises as electricity crackles around the two
                        opponents, sending dirt into the air. Suddenly, they charge and their swords
                        clash violently, their single wings extending and sending them airborne.
                        They trade blows over and over, neither side gaining the upper hand. They
                        split apart and Cloud charges, this time pushing Sephiroth back. Before his
                        blade hits him, Sephiroth teleports away, leaving only feathers. Cloud looks
                        up, glaring at Sephiroth who extends a hand to him. He smiles, only angering
                        Cloud further, and the two soldiers clash swords, sending out a white hot
                        light through the sky. At this time, a portal appears in the Castle Chapel
                        at Hollow Bastion, alerting the princesses to its presence</desc>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Cinderella</speaker> Could the appearance of that gate be a bad
                        omen?</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Snow White</speaker> There’s an ominous presence beyond the gate.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Alice</speaker> What is this feeling? It’s different from darkness...
                        Be careful, Sora!</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Aurora</speaker> I sense a presence coming from that gate... But it’s
                        not darkness. It’s another power altogether. It may be even more dangerous
                        than darkness.</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Jasmine</speaker> We could suppress the power if it were darkness. But
                        this is different. It’s a force unlike darkness... A force different from
                        both the light and the darkness.</sp>
        </cutscene>
        <cutscene>
                <desc>Sora, Donald, Goofy, and Beast enter the portal, finding themselves in the
                        room where Maleficent was defeated. An invisible figure shimmers in the air
                        behind them, walking closer towards Sora, who turns and gasps as a man in a
                        black cloak walks right through him. The world freezes and memories flash
                        through Sora’s mind in rapid succession <q>No problem. Let’s do it! Hold on!
                                What’s that over there? She arrived on the night of the meteor
                                shower! A huge black thing swallowed me up. So, you’re from another
                                world? A paopu fruit... What? There’s no way you’re getting this!
                                I’m so glad that you’re okay, Kairi. The Keyblade... The Heartless?
                                I wonder if I could find Riku and Kairi... Anyway, she’s not the one
                                you’re looking for. That’s the power of the Keyblade! Now I finally
                                know what you mean about strength of heart. Right, my friends! Sorry
                                about what I said. Guess you don’t get out much, huh? I promise.
                                You’re stupid. Sooner or later they’ll swallow your heart. I’ve
                                finally found her. I still can’t believe it. I know this place...
                                No. Not without Kairi. I know now I don’t need a Keyblade. I don’t
                                need a weapon. My friends are my power! Give him back his heart!
                                There’s no way you’re taking Kairi’s heart! A Keyblade that unlocks
                                people’s hearts... I wonder. What’s... What’s happening to me?
                                Falling...falling...into darkness. Kairi, thank you. Now, it’s time
                                to get Riku back. Even if we’re apart, we’re not alone anymore.
                                Don’t worry. I will. Promise.</q>

                <desc>The hooded figure conjures orbs of energy in both hands and flies at them in a
                        flurry of darkness, the orbs exploding into giant damaging force fields,
                        knocking Sora and his friends back. Sora slides back at the man and strikes,
                        while Donald sends magic from a safe distance. The figure then teleports
                        around the room, his speed increasing, surrounded by a dark cloud. The man
                        summons red ethereal blades from his hands and spins closer to Sora, trying
                        to strike him wild and violently. After a few more strikes, the man conjures
                        a ring of blue lasers in the air, firing them towards Sora. He shrouds the
                        room in darkness, sending out lasers from all around his body, nearly
                        finishing off Goofy and the Beast. After forcefully dodging a numerous
                        amount of attacks and countering with his own, the man’s chest glows with
                        energy. He slashes out his hand and dispels it</desc>

                        stands there. Sora whirls around, scowling</desc>

                        Dalmatian puppies they found along their travels. They enter the Dalmatian’s
                        House. A puppy runs up to Pongo and Perdita, looking much jollier than when
                        Sora saw them last. It barks happily up at them. Sora enters the Living
                        Room, seeing numerous puppies scattered around stretching, yawning, and
                        playing. Pongo walks up to him and gives him a present. Perdita joins him
                        and a puppy barks at their feet. In the Piano Room, dozens of puppies play
                        on the piano, as more lay happily on the couch in the Den. Several run along
                        the floor as Sora enters, and a bunch of them gather around him as he
                        scratches his head. Pongo looks over at Perdita and then happily back at
                        their 99 puppies safe and sound. Afterwards, they leave for Merlin’s Study.
                        Sora enters the 100 Acre Wood, arriving a a winding, muddy path. He finds
                        Pooh, wandering in circles around a bramble bush, his footprints trailing
                        him in the mud</desc>

                <sp>
            <speaker>Pooh</speaker> The people who took everyone away. See their footprints?
                        We were all sticking together to make sure no one got lost again. But then,
                        I saw some footprints that needed following. So I did. Suddenly, everyone
                        was gone. Bad people must have taken them away!</sp>
                <sp>
            <speaker>Sora</speaker> Actually, Pooh, I think those footprints are... Um...

                        with a flaming pillar burning in the center. They jump into the enchanted
                        flame and find themselves in a long tiled hallway with a large Heartless
                        insignia at the end of it. They defeat the Heartless that appear around them
                        and a door opens in the wall, leading to a room with a mysterious device. On
                        the panel of the device a message is written <q>Ones born of the heart and
                                darkness, devoid of hearts, ravage all worlds and bring desolation.
                                Seize all hearts and consummate the great heart. All hearts to be
                                one, one heart to encompass all. Realize the destiny: the realm of
                                Kingdom Hearts. The great darkness sealed within the great heart.
                                Progeny of darkness, come back to the eternal darkness. For the
                                heart of light shall unseal the path. Seven hearts, one Keyhole, one
                                key to the door. The door of darkness, tied by two keys. The door of
                                darkness to seal the light. None shall pass but shadows, returning
                                to the darkness. Ones born of the heart and darkness, hunger for
                                every heart until the dark door opens.</q>

                <desc>They return to the hallway and jump into the dark portal in the wall.
                        Returning to the stark cave, the pillar of flame has become a swirling hole
                        in the floor. They enter the hole and arrive in the Evil Grounds, where they
                        float through the dark air. Beneath them is a curved figure with two giant
                        wings. As they hover closer to it, its glowing eyes open and it spreads its
                        wings out, stretching up to its full height. The demon Chernabog crosses its
                        arms and showers them with its evil gaze. It stands in the caldera of a
                        volcano, fire coursing through its veins. They fly towards the beast’s head
                        and begin attacking It. It swipes a mighty claw at them, tossing them away
                        before hunching over. They glide back to the demon and it raises its arms,
                        roaring loudly as an enormous torrent of flames washes over them from the
                        volcano, swirling voraciously around Chernabog. Donald sends a Blizzaga
                        spell at the beast and it begins to spew fire from its mouth. They fly
                        behind it and attack its neck, dodging another wall of fire. It knocks them
                        away again and holds out its arms, spinning them in the air. Spirits appear,
                        dancing near the end of its fingers, and it sends them after the trio.
                        Donald casts Aeroga on everyone as they fly back into the fray, dodging the
                        attacking spirits. After tussling with the dark demon, it roars and bursts
                        into a pillar of white hot flames, flapping its huge wings for a final time
                        before sinking into the volcano and vanishing. Sora, Donald, and Goofy float
                        down through the crater where they find a white portal. They enter it and
                        find themselves in a long tunnel filled with ruins. Dark vines line the
                        walls, a grove of round trees in one corner and stone debris in another.
                        They enter a second white portal and reach another corridor. Shadows of
                        wicked trees cover the walls, their evil faces seemingly watching them as
                        they traverse the somewhat darker tunnel. An image of a small door is etched
                        in the wall. They enter another portal to another tunnel, the most hollow of
                        all. The image of a castle is displayed on the wall, the entire cavern
                        giving them an bleak feeling. They reach a large room with a Heartless
                        symbol placed in the wall. A Behemoth appears, but they defeat it and walk
                        over to the symbol. A piece breaks off and disappears. They defeat an almost
                        endless horde of Heartless, with the pieces of the emblem deteriorating as
                        they battle. Soon, the emblem shines and reveals a hidden room. They step
                        into the sandy chamber, dust falling through holes in the walls. They see a
                        large ornate door and something stirs in Sora’s memory</desc>

                        Beyond the gashing tears is a dark, mad world. The beach crumbles and lifts
                        out of the water, revealing its rocky undergrowth as what once was a dock
                        splits in two. Ansem stands at the edge of the water, still in possession of
                        Riku’s body. They run down to the beach where he stands motionless, staring

                <desc>Behind him, darkness bursts from his body, forming into a large black

                        the Heartless throws scythes of energy at them. Sora dodges them, rolling to
                        the side as Ansem floats above them. Sora moves in, striking the man</desc>

                        Ansem floats down to them and the Guardian swipes at them with a large hand.
                        The fight continues until Ansem flies toward the large tree on the island,
                        which starts to rumble. The branches shake violently as the tree is rent
                        asunder, splitting into a corrupt area of vine and sinew. Ansem waits inside
                        with the Guardian. Sora, Donald, and Goofy run up to the area, but Donald
                        and Goofy are blocked by a barrier. The island shakes and the great black
                        shape of Darkside rises from the floor, its wings stretching out behind it.
                        Sora fights and defeats the giant Heartless, prompting Ansem to emerge from

                <desc>Ansem swings his hand, summoning Bit Sniper Heartless, which fly after Sora,
                        their bat-like wings flapping in the air. They try to sideswipe him, but are
                        met with the Keyblade and disappear. Dodging more lasers, he heals and casts
                        a barrier of air around him, flying back to Ansem to finish this once and
                        for all. To Sora’s surprise, he dispels his sword and crosses his arms over
                        his body. A large Heartless insignia appears over him, blocking him from all
                        attack. The portal over the cage reappears and Sora flies into it, finding
                        himself in pitch black room. He is confronted by a horde of Shadow
                        Heartless, the only light coming from the Heartless emblem on the floor and
                        their eerie glowing eyes. As he destroys the Shadows, a long thread appears
                        in the middle of the room, glowing with dark energy. Sora strikes at the
                        Room Core, which explodes, sending Sora back to the World of Chaos. The
                        Guardian stares down at him, though Ansem doesn’t make a move. On the front
                        of the living battleship, the fleshy artillery begins to shoot homing beams
                        of energy at him and another portal appears above them in front of the
                        Guardian. The artillery wiggle at the expellant force as Sora flies nearer
                        to the portal. He is nearly overwhelmed by the artillery and as he closes in
                        on the portal, the Guardian slams his great claws forward, creating a
                        roaring gust of wind, sending Sora toppling away. He is again assaulted by
                        laser-emitting orbs, but he quickly dodges in midair and flies back to the
                        artillery. After destroying the armaments, he soars into the portal of
                        darkness, finding himself in another dark room filled with Darkball
                        Heartless</desc>

                <desc>Sora finds Goofy in the room as well and they take down the Darkballs and the
                        following Room Core. They fly back into the World of Chaos, where the
                        hugely-fanged Face at the front of the battleship opens its gaping maw,
                        staring at them through horrid yellow eyes. They strike at the Face, which
                        clenches its teeth, sending bolts of lightning at them. It rears its head
                        back as they attack and opens its mouth, sending an explosion of energy
                        around them while its eyes glow. Taking the final blow, it roars and its
                        head falls limp, the mouth opening. Another portal of darkness appears
                        inside its jaw as more artillery appear on the front armaments of the
                        battleship. Sora and Goofy fly into the portal, reaching another dark room
                        filled with Invisible Heartless</desc>

                        runs toward their voices as the three of the fight off the countless horde.
                        Sora destroys the final Room Core and they escape the room through the
                        portal. They fly back out of the mouth of the Face, which brims with smoke
                        and explodes, leaving a dark blue wound on the front of the World of Chaos.
                        The barrier to the cage in the battleship’s center collapses and they fly
                        inside the cage, where they find the Main Core surrounded by artillery. They
                        attack the Main Core as the artillery strike back</desc>

                        descend to meet it. He touches them with the Keyblade and they gather,
                        forming a three ringed orb. Sora jumps upside down, thrusting the Keyblade
                        into the flesh of the cage. He spins around, holding the grip of the blade
                        as a bright symbol appears around him. Beams erupt from the circles in the
                        symbol and the orb above and the world is enveloped in light. The Main Core
                        crackles with energy as the light fades. Energy catches its grip and it
                        explodes. The Heartless Emblem above Ansem’s body shatters and Ansem slides
                        forward, his silver hair trailing behind him. Straightening up, he crosses
                        his hands and his pole sword reappears as he glares at Sora, Donald, and

                        gigantic orb, it explodes, its energy scattering through the abyss. Sora,

                        dust, and raises it into the air. The door begins to glow brightly and soon
                        disappears, revealing a long winding pathway behind it. Sora, Donald, and
                        Goofy stand still gazing into the void left in the door’s wake. Sora’s
                        thoughts drift to Riku and their life on the Destiny Islands. When they
                        talked for hours on the dock. When they gazed out at the sea from the paopu
                        tree. When they used to play fight or race along the beach, laughing at each
                        other. Life was a much simpler time then, before the Heartless. When it was
                        just Sora, Riku and... Sora feels a presence behind him and turns, seeing
                        Kairi at the edge of the world staring around in confusion. Sora runs
                        towards her as fast as he can. Donald starts to follow, but Goofy stops him
                        as a light appears behind them. They stare off in Sora’s direction as he
                        runs toward the only thing on his mind. Kairi takes a few steps backward,
                        her shoes digging into the soft sand on the tiny piece of beach she appeared
                        on. It seems to be floating off the floating island into the abyss. Kairi

                <desc>Their hands part and Kairi drifts away from Sora, who reaches out to her. She
                        folds her hands together as they continue to stare back, when a small point
                        of light floats down into Kairi’s hands. She looks up and the sky is filled
                        with tiny points of light, the essence of worlds. They float down around the
                        both of them as the Destiny Islands begin to reassemble around Kairi. Trees
                        burst through the ground as the wooden platforms at the beach reform to the
                        way they used to be. Kairi watches as the ocean rolls in. Sora smiles and
                        calls out to Kairi as the world barrier forms, finally separating the two of
                        them. Kairi looks down to the water as the light around Sora falls back. She
                        looks up suddenly as the light bursts into shooting stars which fly into the
                        sky, reclaiming their proper places. As the worlds are restored, Kairi’s
                        face forms a small smile as she gazes at the beauty around her. Later, the
                        sun and the clouds return and the island returns to normal. A soft wind
                        blows through the flora and seagulls fly in the air as Kairi walks toward
                        the Secret Place. A ray of light shines through the hole in the ceiling,
                        illuminating the many drawings on the walls. She walks through the cave,
                        touching the rough rocky walls, fondly recalling the memories with her
                        friends. She reaches the furthest wall and kneels, seeing a new drawing of
                        Sora giving Kairi a paopu fruit. Emotion wells up inside her as an image of
                        Sora drawing on the walls appears before her. He stares back at her and
                        smiles, before disappearing. She holds out a hand, smiling, and starts to
                        cry. She ends her time in the Secret Place by drawing her hand giving Sora a
                        paopu fruit. Back in Disney Castle, Chip and Dale call to the attention of
                        Daisy and Queen Minnie. They look and see Huey, Dewey, and Louie running
                        through the courtyard trailed by a procession of walking broomsticks. In the
                        Library of Hollow Bastion, Leon, Yuffie, and Aerith converse with each
                        other. The door opens and Aerith looks over seeing Cid and Cloud. Aerith
                        moves closer and she bends down to stare into Cloud’s eyes. Meanwhile,
                        Pinocchio has become a real boy and he dances with glee as Geppetto laughs
                        happily. In Agrabah, Jasmine and Aladdin share a passionate kiss as Genie
                        covers his and Abu’s eyes, but peeks anyway. On the Destiny Islands, Tidus,
                        Wakka, and Selphie run along the beach as Belle, Aurora, Snow White,
                        Cinderella, and Alice return to their respective worlds. Meanwhile, Sora,
                        Donald, and Goofy walk down a winding dirt road on an unknown world</desc>

                <desc>With a flash, the dark city awakes. The neon lights paint the town as a hooded
                        figure walks through the rainy streets. Raindrops form puddles on the
                        pavement. Thunder rumbles and lightning flashes as the figure stops in front
                        of a tall skyscraper with enormous video screens. Water falls over the man’s
                        hood as he looks down to see glowing eyes appear from the ground. The
                        Neoshadow Heartless rise up from below, unfazed by the cold rain. They
                        quickly surround the man in an immense horde as a silver-haired man gazes
                        down at him from above, despite the black blindfold across his eyes. The man
                        whips out a Keyblade in his left hand, and then another in his right. He
                        spins them in the air and clashes them together, creating sparks. They are
                        the Oathkeeper and the Oblivion. Light and Darkness. Lightning flashes and
                        the silver-haired man faces the sky with his arms outstretched. The clouds
                        part, revealing a meteor shower as a fiery Heartless symbol appears on the
                        ground between the hooded man and the Heartless. The silver-haired man
                        removes his blindfold as the hooded man speaks <q>Where’s Sora?</q>
