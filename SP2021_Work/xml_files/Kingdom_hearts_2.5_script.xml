                <speaker>Sora</speaker> A scattered dream that's like a far-off memory. A far-off
                memory that's like a scattered dream. I want to line the pieces up--yours and

        <cutscene type='Opening' cutNum='2' location='Unknown'>
                <desc>Kairi sits on the Destiny Islands beach, making a charm of thalassa shells. A
                        shell is washed away in the water. Sora, Kairi, and Riku watch the sunset,
                        dreaming of other worlds. Kairi, Riku, and eventually Destiny Islands itself
                        disappears with the wind. Sora jumps off the paopu tree and lands at the
                        Rising Falls in Hollow Bastion with Donald and Goofy. Sora jumps up the
                        platforms, defeating Shadow Heartless. He sees Kairi lying in the Grand Hall
                        of the castle and runs to her. He kneels down beside her and holds her. He
                        turns his head and sees Riku, who turns around and holds out his hand to
                        Sora. A large wave comes up behind him, and Sora appears on Destiny Islands.
                        He runs to Riku with his Keyblade. In the Grand Hall, Sora and Riku's blades
                        clash. Sora spins to hits him, but he leaps into the air. Pieces fly off him
                        as he falls near the entrance to the Dark Depths, revealing him as Ansem.
                        Sora leaps into the air and slams down his Keyblade. The door to Kingdom
                        Hearts opens and light pours out. Ansem shields his eyes with his arm. Riku
                        makes a promise to Sora as the door closes. Sora's heart is opened by the
                        Keyblade, and the princesses' hearts are released. Sora holds Kairi close.
                        Kairi stands on Destiny Islands staring out at the water. Day turns into
                        night and lights fall around Kairi as she watches Sora leave. Kairi stands
                        again at the water, but she is now older. Cross to Naminé, who's drawing in
                        Castle Oblivion. The spiral stairs become reality and Sora, Donald, and
                        Goofy run up them fighting Heartless. Goofy smashes one with his shield.
                        Donald performs Thunder. Sora sees DiZ and a figure in black through the
                        blue smoke. A white hall forms around them and Sora finds himself alone,
                        facing down Marluxia, who smirks. Sora runs forward. Marluxia swipes with
                        his scythe. Sora flies forward, dodging another swing from the scythe. Riku
                        leaps backwards, away from a blast from Ansem, catching himself and running
                        forward. Sora and Riku exchange blocks and blows with Marluxia and Ansem.
                        Sora throws his Keyblade at Marluxia, who stops it with his scythe. Sora,
                        Donald, and Goofy run up through Castle Oblivion's spiral stairs as Riku and
                        Mickey descend them. As Naminé is drawing, Sora enters the room. On Naminé's
                        pad is a drawing of Sora inside a capsule. Sora looks down and a capsule
                        blasts up and envelops him. He looks helpless at a sad Naminé. Sora starts
                        to fall. He soars across the water to Destiny Islands. Naminé closes her
                        sketchbook on a picture of a sleeping Sora. Sora, Kairi, and Riku lie hand
                        in hand upon the beach. Roxas falls down through the water. He wakes up and
                        lands on hard ground. He looks around warily but sees nothing. He steps
                        forward, and covers his face as hundreds of birds fly out of a bright light,
                        revealing a platform with Sora adorned on it. Roxas watches as the birds fly
                        away. At a dark ocean beach, two people in black coats meet, one sitting on
                        a rock overlooking the beach</desc>

                        train passes on the tracks overhead. Hayner, Olette, and Pence are enjoying
                        conversation, while Roxas sits thinking. The words 'The 1st Day' appear on

                And we've got a score to settle with Seifer and everything. So if he wants to think
                we did it, I can't really blame him. See...that's not what really bugs me. What
                really bugs me is that he's goin' around tellin' everybody we're the thieves! Now
                the whole town and their mothers are treating us like the Klepto Club! Have you ever

        <sp>
                <speaker>Olette</speaker> 3600 munny.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Hayner</speaker> And 300 each to spend there. What's that for all of

        <sp>
                <speaker>Olette</speaker> 1200 munny. A total of 4800 munny.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Hayner</speaker> Too pricey. They're, like, 2000 munny apiece.</sp>

        <sp>

        <sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Hayner</speaker> That's 1600 munny! We need another 3200. Let's find

                can't think of his face, or his name. I feel awful about it. So I told myself--I'm
                not going to the island until I remember everything about him.</sp>

                apart the memories chained together in Sora's heart. But now... I'm putting them all
                back exactly the way they were. It's taken me a long time, but pretty soon Sora will
                be his old self again. The process has been affecting you, too, Roxas.</sp>

                        destroys several of the Neoshadows before looking up to the top of the main
                        skyscraper of the city. The rain has stopped for a moment. An unhooded but
                        blindfolded man stands at the top of the skyscraper. The duel-wielding
                        person runs up the side of the building and tosses the Oblivion Keyblade to
                        the man at the top, who dives off the edge of the building and catches the

                <desc>Roxas gets a vision of Sora holding out his Keyblade. Roxas steps back from
                        the gate and unlocks the keyhole in it. The gates open and he runs inside.
                        The Dusks try to follow but are stopped by a hooded figure holding a
                        wing-like sword. Roxas enters the mansion and finds the White Room. Roxas
                        walks past pictures he saw when he was in this room before and stops at one
                        of him in an alleyway of the dark city he saw in his dreams. He gets a
                        sudden headache. Thunder rumbles in the sky of the city as a cloaked Roxas
                        walks through the dark streets. He passes Axel who is leaning on the wall,
                        crossing his arms</desc>

        <cutscene type='' cutNum='' location=''>
                <desc>He moves his arm and opens a dark portal. Naminé looks to Axel, then back to

                <desc>Naminé stands up walks slowly toward the portal, keeping her eyes on the

                        after and it closes. The train pulls onto the base of a mysterious tower,
                        emblazoned with moons and stars like the train. Sora, Donald, and Goofy
                        leave the train, which then disappears, leaving only the tracks. Sora
                        giggles nervously</desc>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Pete</speaker> I sent some of my lackeys inside to see if the master of
                this here tower's as big and tough as they say. Word is, he's a real powerful
                sorcerer. Which would make him the perfect bodyguard for me. See, it don't matter
                how tough he is---once he's a Heartless, he'll do as I say!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> A Heartless?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Pete</speaker> That's right. They're those things that come outta the
                darkness in folks' hearts. Why, with all those Heartless at her side, my dear friend
                Maleficent is gonna conquer everything! And since I got me a debt to pay, I'm goin'
                'round to a bunch of different worlds and buildin' an army of Heartless, special for
                her. Why am I talkin' to you pipsqueaks anyway? Go on, scram! I'm behind schedule as
                it is.</sp>

                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> So, you are Sora. Now then, have you seen the King
                yet?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Yes, we did, Master. But we didn't get a chance to talk to
                him.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> Yes...the King has been quite busy of late. Therefore, it
                would seem that the task of instructing you three falls upon my shoulders. You have
                a perilous journey ahead of you. You must be well prepared.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> You mean...we have to go on another quest? I was looking
                forward to finding my friend Riku, so we could go back to the islands.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> Yes. I know. However, everything in your journey, Sora,
                is connected. Whether you will find your way home to the islands... Whether you will
                return alone or with your friend... And, whether or not the islands will still be
                there. And the key that connects them all is you, Sora.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> I'm...the key?</sp>

        <cutscene type='' cutNum='' location=''>

        </cutscene>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> Chosen wielder of the Keyblade! You are the key that will
                open the door to light.</sp>

        <cutscene type='' cutNum='' location=''>
                <desc>Sora nods. Yen Sid looks to Donald and Goofy who quickly stand up straight and
                        nod. Yen Sid waves a hand over the table and a thick book appears. He makes
                        it float into the air and spins it toward Sora. It opens and lands at the
                        edge of the table</desc>
        </cutscene>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> This book contains valuable knowledge you will need for
                your journey. Study it carefully. Once you have finished, we will speak of the
                enemies you will surely confront.</sp>

        <cutscene type='' cutNum='' location=''>
                <desc>Sora reads the book <q>The Beginning</q> - Each journey gives rise to chance
                        encounters, and each encounter brings forth a farewell. When a farewell
                        leads to a journey, the worlds open their hearts. Those chosen by the light,
                        or ensnared by darkness. Friends who share the same bonds, though their
                        paths may differ. When you doubt the path trod thus far, when the hand you
                        held is lost to you, gaze anew at the heart that once was...for all the
                        answers are within. <q>Interlude</q> - A long dream. A sad farewell, hanging
                        in the air in that <q>world between</q>. What is reality? What is illusion?
                        The path chosen by the young boy leads to his memories. When caught in the
                        stream of the days and nights going past, gaze anew at your steps...for
                        there all confusion will end. <q>The Future Story</q> - Will the day come
                        when this battle, born of confusion, will end? It is different things to
                        different people. Can the reality be that which is hidden? The reason is
                        mere existence. Still, memories can be believed. Be not afraid. Entrust your
                        body to the soothing waves of your memories. By and by, your fleeting rest
                        will be over...and everything will begin.</desc>
        </cutscene>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> But wait a sec---how come the Heartless are still running
                around?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> Your past endeavors did prevent an immense effusion of
                Heartless from the great darkness; make no mistake about that. However, the
                Heartless are darkness made real---and darkness lingers yet in every heart. The
                Heartless are fewer. But while darkness exists in a single heart, it will be
                difficult to eliminate them.</sp>

        <cutscene type='' cutNum='' location=''>
                <desc>Yen Sid waves a hand and an image of Donald appears near the wall. This image
                        then changes to a Shadow Heartless</desc>
        </cutscene>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> If one such as you, Donald, yields to the darkness in
                their heart, they too will become a Heartless. But you know this. The Heartless are
                always lurking and ever seeking to capture new hearts. Never let your guard down!
                Now then...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> At times, if someone with a strong heart and will---be
                they evil or good---becomes a Heartless, the empty shell they leave behind begins to
                act with a will of its own.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> An empty vessel whose heart has been stolen away... A
                spirit that goes on even as its body fades from existence---for you see, Nobodies do
                not truly exist at all. Nobodies may seem to have feelings, but this is a
                ruse---they only pretend to have hearts. You must not be deceived!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> Now then...the being you see before you is known as a
                Dusk. They are the most common form of Nobody. But there are others---some larger,
                some with frightening and unique powers. Be vigilant! On your journey, you will meet
                an alarming number of Dusks. They will all attempt to do you harm.</sp>

        <cutscene type='' cutNum='' location=''>

        </cutscene>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> Still, they are nothing but empty shells, destined to

                <desc>The wizard waves his hand again and images of figures in black appear in the

        </cutscene>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> The beings you see before you now are different. These
                powerful Nobodies have formed a group called Organization XIII. It commands the
                lesser Nobodies.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Organization XIII...</sp>

        </cutscene>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> While Heartless act on instinct, Nobodies function in a
                higher manner. They can think and plan. And it seems they are working towards a
                goal. What that goal is, we do not know. The King sensed the danger, and journeyed
                forth to fight it. He found the dark realm's Keyblade, and with it, closed the door.
                Now he's traveling from world to world, fighting the Heartless as he seeks the
                answer to the riddle of the Nobodies and Organization XIII.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Then I guess we better go find the King first!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> But where could he be?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Well, we won't know 'til we look.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Yeah. And the King must know where Riku is, 'cause the two

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> So, before you go, you will need more suitable traveling

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Gawrsh, Sora, you sure are growing fast.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Me, you guys, Riku, and the King. I don't care who this
                Organization is or what it's planning. With the five of us---I mean, six of
                us---there's nothing to worry about, right?</sp>

                <speaker>Donald</speaker> Yeah!</sp>

                <desc>The three relax a bit</desc>
        </cutscene>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> Because of your previous endeavors, the worlds have
                returned to their original states. That means the pathways between them have
                disappeared.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> How do we get around?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> Do not fear. If what the King suspected proves true, the
                worlds have prepared new pathways along which you may travel. These pathways may be
                utilized by unlocking special gates. How these gates are opened, I'm afraid I do not
                know... However, the Keyblade will serve as your guide. When a beam of light
                radiates from the Keyblade, return to the Gummi Ship. Though the worlds may seem far
                apart and out of reach, they nonetheless remain connected by invisible ties. As do
                our hearts.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Our hearts are connected.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> That is correct.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Got it!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> But be warned. As you proceed... The Heartless and the
                Nobodies will be using their own paths Corridors of darkness, to travel from world
                to world. They may be attempting to link these dark pathways to the gates between
                the worlds.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> Hey! That's not fair!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Yen Sid</speaker> Now then, that is all the information I can give to you.
                Go forth, Sora, Donald, and Goofy. Everyone is waiting.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Okay, let's get going!</sp>

                <speaker>Shang</speaker> You're welcome in my troop. Your battle skills are

        <sp>
                <speaker>Shang <desc>to Ping</desc>
                </speaker> You should return home.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Ping</speaker> B-but... That would dishonor my family!</sp>

        <sp>

                <speaker>Shang</speaker> Hmm...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Just give us an assignment! We'll show you how well we can
                work together.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Shang</speaker> So...you want to be tested? Our orders are to ambush
                Shan-Yu's army on their way here. They should be coming through the mountain
                pass.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> We'll smash them!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Shang</speaker> I doubt that. You four will be the advance party. Scout out
                the mountain for my troops.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> That's it? No problem. Right?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Ping</speaker> R-right.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Shang</speaker> I'll brief you on the details later. Return when you're
                ready to depart. Remember, the smallest mission may have the greatest purpose. Stay
                alert!</sp>

                <speaker>Shang</speaker> You've done a passable job. But stay alert! This is just
                the beginning. Shan-Yu has invaded our country. We must stop him at all costs. A mob
                is heading for the Checkpoint. Stop them while keeping an eye out for strange
                enemies!</sp>

                assignments. Our objective is to defeat Shan-Yu. Do not fail your mission. It seems
                the enemy has invaded the camp. Defeat every enemy you encounter!</sp>

                have some tasks to do. Stay sharp. You did well.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Ping</speaker> No. You're right, Captain. Please give me one more
                assignment. This time I'll show you what I'm truly made of!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Shang</speaker> I'll give you one more chance. See me when you're ready to
                depart. Remember, this may be a test, but it's still an important mission. Be
                alert!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Wait a second. Who locked who up?</sp>

                <speaker>Belle</speaker> That's what I don't know.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Hmm. Where's this dungeon?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Belle</speaker> You can get to the undercroft from the west hall. The
                dungeon is down there.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> West hall. Got it.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Belle</speaker> Be careful!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Wardrobe</speaker> And I was just starting to get comfortable... May I help
                you?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Huh? What? Oh, right---Belle needs us to go to the
                dungeon.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Wardrobe</speaker> Goodness! You're here to help my friends? Well, why
                didn't you say so?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Er...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Wardrobe</speaker> I'm sorry I startled you. Oh, I used to be human, you
                know, until the enchantress cast her spell. I was turned into a wardrobe when the
                prince was turned into a beast.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> The prince is the Beast!?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> The Beast is a prince!?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Wardrobe</speaker> That's right. Although his behavior was far from
                princely at the time.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> What's this about a...spell?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Wardrobe</speaker> Well, it was a cold winter's night...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Wardrobe</speaker> And that's enough for now. You can hear the rest when
                you've rescued the others. It'll give you something to look forward to.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> Aww...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Wardrobe</speaker> Hurry, now. The dungeon is damp and chilly. Certainly no
                place for a clock!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> A clock?</sp>

        <sp>

                        disappear. The door becomes unlocked</desc>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> That's awful!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Lumiere</speaker> Oui. He was a spoiled prince, so selfish and...how shall

        <sp>
                <speaker>Cogsworth</speaker> And to further punish him, everyone in the castle was

                <speaker>Sora</speaker> He sure is acting weird.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mrs. Potts</speaker> It's almost as if he's forgotten how to trust
                others.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Cogsworth</speaker> You don't suppose he's been turned into a Heartless, do
                you?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora, Donald, &amp; Goofy</speaker> Heartless!?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> If they're a part of this, then it's a good thing we're
                here.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> Let's go find the Beast!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Lumiere</speaker> I'm afraid we won't be marching out that easily. You see,
                the door leading to the other side is concealed by a sort of contraption.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> What kind of contraption?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Cogsworth</speaker> Observe.</sp>

                <desc>Cogsworth jumps onto a crank, which lowers a dark flaming lantern</desc>
        </cutscene>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> The lantern came down!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Lumiere</speaker> Indeed it did. If we could but light all the lanterns in
                this passage the secret door would open...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mrs. Potts</speaker> But, as you can see, the lanterns are already
                burning---with an enchanted flame.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Lumiere</speaker> You must put out this enchanted flame before I am able to
                light the lanterns properly.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Can't ya just throw some water on 'em?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mrs. Potts</speaker> I'm afraid that's not enough. But if you use the power
                of light...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Hmm... How about I try using the Keyblade?</sp>

                <desc>Sora points his Keyblade at the lantern. The enchanted flame dies down and

                <speaker>Lumiere</speaker> Bravo!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mrs. Potts</speaker> Only three lanterns left! If we work together, we'll
                have that door open in no time!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Piece of cake!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Lumiere</speaker> Again, it is not quite so simple, mon ami. Certainly you
                cannot expect Cogsworth to hang from that handle forever?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Cogsworth</speaker> What? Why? Lumiere! You---</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Lumiere</speaker> If he gets tired and falls off, all the unlit lanterns
                will rise to the ceiling again.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mrs. Potts</speaker> Before you can continue, you must see to Cogsworth.
                Once he gets his strength back, he'll grasp the lever again for you.</sp>

        <sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Cogsworth</speaker> No need to worry. Just push that block over there---the

        <sp>
                <speaker>Beast</speaker> Xaldin... that's his name. He came from the darkness...
                He...used my anger to control me. He took all my sorrow, my sadness, my pain---and
                turned it all into rage. There was nothing I could do... I could no longer see the
                truth.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Well, I'll be. That must be why you threw all of your
                friends down there into the dungeon. You wanted to make sure that you didn't hurt
                'em, right?</sp>

        <sp>

        <sp>

                <desc>Belle runs to the balcony door and closes it before a large spiked ball in
                        chains floats down in front of it, trying to go after her. It turns around
                        and changes targets. It floats up to the large candelabra and drops down
                        into the floor. Waves of darkness emanate through the ballroom, poisoning
                        it. Donald jumps into Goofy's arms to get off the floor. The chained ball
                        jumps back out of the floor as the dark pool climbs up the ballroom pillars.
                        It covers the intricate painting on the ceiling and mutates the chandelier.
                        After a short battle, the ball spasms and covers itself in dark webs. The
                        webs burst, revealing a large violet creature with pink throbbing fins
                        attached to its head. It roars and Sora moves into action. After a grueling
                        battle with the monster, it roars and is obliterated. The ballroom returns

                too. See, the Organization...they've got control of all the Nobodies.</sp>

                Heartless. Of course, I fought back with some rather powerful magic, but then I
                began to fear the book would be damaged, so I... Oh! Now, just a moment. Leon and

                Heartless stole. You'll have to collect the torn pages and repair the book to put
                things right. This book is one of the world's most cherished elements. I'd been
                meaning to tell Leon I'd found it, but perhaps we should keep it between us for
                now.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora, Donald, and Goofy</speaker> We will!</sp>

                This is for you, Sora.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> What is it?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Merlin</speaker> Simply concentrate on it with all your heart, and you need
                only say the word to summon an ally who will help in times of need.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Like Simba and Mushu did, the last time we were here?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Merlin</speaker> Precisely. Now go forth, with your friends by your

        <sp>
                <speaker>Pete</speaker> Oh, they're nuttin' but trouble, the whole lot of 'em. So,
                uh...what're you gonna do about Hercules? He's made mince meat outta every fighter
                you sent at him. Pretty soon the Underworld's gonna be standing room only. Say, why
                don't you just pick somebody already dead and save him the trouble?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Hades</speaker> Just the Underworld's deepest dungeon. This time I'm

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Still working on it. When we got here, we ran into
                Meg---meg-mega trouble, I mean! So we had to help somebody out. We tried to go teach
                Hades a thing or two...but the Underworld drains away all our strength. Don't
                suppose you have any ideas?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Hercules</speaker> Well, there is a stone that guards against the
                Underworld's curse. The gods on Mount Olympus use it whenever they have to go down
                there.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Think we could use it?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Hercules</speaker> Sure, why not! I'll go get it for you.</sp>

        <sp>

                you. Victory in the games comes down to two simple words Eat, bathe, sleep!</sp>

                in white.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Really!?</sp>

        <sp>

                course. But there's something else to do first. Somewhere in that world, there
                should be another door that's identical to this one. I believe our enemies are
                utilizing that door. As long as it remains open, the castle will be in grave danger.
                Listen carefully, Sora. You must find that door. And when you do---lock it with your
                Keyblade.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Got it.</sp>

        <sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Merlin</speaker> Now, one more thing. You're heading into a very special
                world. While you're there, the nature of that world may tempt you to do something
                dark. You must resist that temptation at all costs!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> What do you mean?</sp>

        <sp>

                pieces of the Aztec gold must be gathered and restored to the stone chest. And the
                blood of every soul who touched a piece o' the treasure must be repaid.</sp>

                last. All those years, you been safe in your bed, readin' your pirate stories,
                dreamin' of adventure on the high seas---we've endured torments worse than death

                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> Ah, lad... He and I once had our eyes on a
                treasure---Aztec gold. 'Twas hidden on the Isla de Muerta. But he turned traitor and
                stole my ship.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> So he's after that treasure, then.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> Treasure's already his. So's the curse upon it. I've
                no desire for such treacherous spoils. But I will have back what's mine---the Black
                Pearl.</sp>

                <speaker>Sora</speaker> But you'll have to win over Aladdin and Jasmine yourself. Be
                on your best behavior, got it?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Iago</speaker> Yeah, I got it.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Where IS Aladdin, anyway?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Iago</speaker> I betcha he's at the palace.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Then let's go!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jasmine</speaker> I never had the chance to thank you for before. You
                helped Aladdin defeat that awful Jafar and saved Agrabah.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> All in a day's work. But uh... it looks like the Heartless
                are up to no good again.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jasmine</speaker> I think we're all right for now.</sp>

        <sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jasmine</speaker> He...hasn't been himself lately.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> Is it because of the Heartless?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jasmine</speaker> I'm not sure. Usually, he's the same cheerful Aladdin.
                But sometimes...he just seems sad. He leaves the palace and goes off by himself all
                the time. I've asked him about it, but he says nothing's wrong. He's gone again
                today. What if he doesn't come back this time?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Iago</speaker> Hey, maybe he's got a secret girlfriend. I know! I'll go

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Princess Jasmine. She's worried 'cause you're always in

                There's always something goin' on. I mean, c'mon! I met you guys here today, right?
                This place is full of surprises.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Peddler</speaker> Ah, well---perhaps I can be persuaded...IF you bring me a
                treasure beyond even my imagination. Something, say, fit for a sultan...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Aladdin</speaker> But it's not mine to take. And I can't ask. I don't want

                <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> I was so looking forward to destroying that ridiculous
                Christmas Town. But now that Sora and those imbeciles are here I think a change of
                plan is called for. Revenge before pleasure, after all.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Shock</speaker> What kind of revenge?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> The magnificent, malevolent kind, of course.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Lock</speaker> That sounds really bad.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Shock</speaker> Like Oogie's kinda bad!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Barrel</speaker> And that's super-duper bad!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Oogie Boogie? That bag of incensed insects? How
                intriguing. And where might I find him?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Shock</speaker> Jack and his dumb, stupid friend destroyed him.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Ah yes, now I remember. More intriguing still! I
                believe I'll bring your master back for you.</sp>

                Maleficent.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Indeed you do, Oogie. Do you remember Sora, Donald,
                and Goofy?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Oogie Boogie</speaker> Do I remember them? Ha! You're too much! I'll never
                forget what they did to me... Uh...What was it they did to me?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Shock</speaker> Squashed you like a bug!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Oogie Boogie</speaker> That sounds bad!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Lock</speaker> And Jack helped!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Oogie Boogie</speaker> Even worse!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Barrel</speaker> They creamed ya!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Oogie Boogie</speaker> That's right, that's right! That's one thing I won't
                be forgetting any time soon! It's the last thing I remember. And it's the only thing
                I remember until I teach those clowns not to mess with Mr. Oogie Boogie!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Maleficent</speaker> Yes...that's right. That's the spirit. And I have the

                You see... It's very important that you go back to Christmas Town. I'm afraid

                destroying Christmas Town. That's sure to make Sora and the other fools come
                running.</sp>

                <speaker>Jack</speaker> I just thought you could use a little help this year, Mr.
                Claws. You must be exhausted from all the preparations. And---I wouldn't mind a
                second chance to get this Christmas thing right.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Santa</speaker> Yes, being Santa Claus can be tiring. But let me tell you
                something, Jack. Seeing the happy faces of little children when they discover the
                presents I've brought them makes it all worthwhile, year after year after year. And
                you, Jack---you love to make them gasp and see them shiver with fright. What if
                someone tried to take all of that away from you?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Santa</speaker> We both have very important jobs to do, Jack. Mine is to
                take care of Christmas, and yours is to take care of Halloween. So we each have to
                do the very best we can. After all, you're the face of Halloween---Mr. Jack
                Skellington! The Pumpkin King! The Knight of Nightmares! And even though you're
                fascinated with Christmas, Jack...Halloween is your true specialty. Don't you see?
                Children rely on both of us to do our jobs. Halloween needs your attention...and I
                know Christmas needs mine---urgently.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack</speaker> You're right! I am the master of terror! And if Halloween
                has become too routine, all I have to do is think of something new that'll really
                make them scream!</sp>

                <speaker>Mayor <desc>running towards them</desc>
                </speaker> Jack! Oh, Jack! I've been looking for you everywhere! We must go over the
                plans for next Halloween! I can't do a thing without your approval!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack</speaker> So true.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Santa</speaker> Good luck, Jack Skellington.</sp>

                to finish!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Santa</speaker> Before you do, Sora... I believe there's a friend of
                yours...who---if I recall correctly---was the one who told you there's no such thing
                as Santa Claus?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Oh yeah... He did say that.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Santa</speaker> Be sure to give him my very best wishes.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> I will, but... Do you know where I can find Riku?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Santa</speaker> No...but don't give up! Remember, if you believe in Riku,
                you will find him. Just as you found me.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Right!</sp>

                <desc>Sora, Donald, and Goofy leave Halloween Town. They pilot the Gummi Ship
                        through Sunlight Storm and land in an African savannah. A lone lion cub
                        stands in a large rocky gorge. He looks around a bit and sees tiny stone
                        rattling on the ground. He feels the vibrations getting stronger and looks
                        up. Over its steep edge, hundreds of wildebeest storm the gorge. The cub
                        looks at it frightfully. He runs as they're upon him, until he comes to a
                        single tree in the center and climbs on. He hangs onto the branch. A
                        wildebeest knocks into it and sends the cub flying. A large lion runs
                        against the flood of wildebeest and catch the cub in his mouth. He climbs up
                        the side of the gorge and lets the cub down, but is pulled back in by the
                        other animals. The cub looks down in horror watching for a sign of his
                        father. The lion springs up out of the fray and grabs onto the rock face.
                        The cub watches expectantly as the lion creeps up the side of the gorge. He
                        slips slightly and the cub runs around to find a higher viewing point. The
                        lion looks up to see a darker-colored lion approaching the edge of the
                        gorge. Simba turns around just as his father gets thrown back into the horde
                        of wildebeest with a loud roar</desc>

                could be king?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Nala</speaker> There was... but he died... when he was just a cub. He was
                the son of our last king, Mufasa. If only Simba were here...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Simba!? But Simba's just fine! He was fighting right beside

                lost, when it may never have existed in the first place. He deserves nothing more

        <sp>
                <speaker>Tron</speaker> Because I want to help them. Something written into my code

                better get to work. It's what my User would want.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Listen, Tron. We didn't get the password from Ansem. We just
                sort of found it, back in the User world. By accident. And one more
                thing...Ansem---he was our enemy. I mean...he still is...I guess.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Tron</speaker> Well, actually...he's my enemy, too.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> What do you mean?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Tron</speaker> Ansem took ENCOM's original system and customized it for his
                own use. I was part of the original system, and Ansem modified me, too. So that
                makes him my User.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Tron</speaker> But Ansem is also the one who brought back the MCP. The
                Ansem I first knew wouldn't do that. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> That's okay...but now I REALLY don't get it.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Tron</speaker> I don't...understand it either. But I think Users, like you,
                are going to be the ones who will finally figure it out. You have the ability to
                take illogical routes and still arrive at the answers you seek. Now go---before the
                MCP starts acting up again! Any data you need from the DTD can be accessed directly
                through my User's terminal. I'll keep a dedicated access channel open for you. I
                changed the password, so you won't have to worry about the MCP for a while.</sp>

                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Well, let's see. Some feller named Ansem, who wasn't really
                Ansem, became a Heartless. Does that mean a Nobody got created when that happened,
                too?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> Yup! And that Nobody is the leader of the
                Organization.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora, Donald, &amp; Goofy</speaker> Whaaaat?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey <desc>looking at the painting</desc>
                </speaker> I know I've met this fake Ansem before, and I've seen the leader of
                Organization XIII, too. Hmm, kinda felt like bein' around the same fella.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> So, where did you meet this guy?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> Gosh...I can't remember. Ansem the Wise---the real
                Ansem---must know the imposter's true identity. That's why I've got to find him and
                ask him about it.</sp>

                <speaker>Sora <desc>glaring at the painting</desc>
                </speaker> You...! You started all of this! Because of you, Riku and Kairi... Oh!
                Your Majesty, do you know where Riku is?</sp>

                <speaker>Mickey <desc>looking away from Sora</desc>

                Ansem the Wise. But---now I know I forgot the most important thing. Helping others
                should always come before asking others for help. We're safe and sound---and free to
                choose! So there's no reason we shouldn't choose to help our friends.</sp>

                <desc>They leave over the rock face, and Mickey sighs. A camera in Ansem's computer
                        room scans the area. It moves to the door, where a hooded figure stands, and
                        scans for data. The word 'unknown' flashes on the screen and the figure
                        points to the camera. There is a flash of light and the camera is knocked
                        into static and turns off. The hooded one walks over to the computer and
                        inserts a disk. The monitor displays the words <q>Now Loading</q> before
                        switching to an entry bar. The man types in <q>Another</q> and the computer
                        brings him to another screen with six entry bars gathered around an inner
                        circle symbol. He types passwords into each of these and the screen switches
                        to <q>System Start</q>. The computer returns to the normal screen and the
                        disk is ejected. The figure takes the disk and pockets it, walking toward
                        the now open door at the edge of the room. He walks down the long stairs in
                        the Heartless Manufactory and steps onto a lighted panel. The floor before
                        him slides open from the center and lights up. He walks through and the
                        floor closes. He walks down the ramp, which disappears, and steps down a
                        spiral hallway. His thoughts travel back to several years ago</desc>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Ansem the Wise</speaker> I forbid it! Forget this talk of doors, and the

                <desc>The figure gets to the end of the staircase and stops. The door in front of
                        him opens with a flash and he enters a white hallway. He walks past several
                        barred and diamond-windowed cells with digital locks and comes to another
                        door. The door slides open. He enters a while room with black chains and
                        Nobody symbols lining the walls and floor. The door closes behind him and he
                        places his hand on the chair in the center of the room before sitting down.
                        The chains and symbols glow white, eminating from the central chair. The
                        glow crawls toward a blue figure lying on the floor</desc>

                since I've been working so hard, I had Lexaeus take my place for the day. I want to

                key-shaped swords appeared and unleashed a spectacular battle. And when it was all
                over, all that was left was a man lying unconscious without his memories.
                Xemnas--Uh, I mean Xehanort, was found by Ansem right around then, wasn't he?</sp>

        <sp>

                we spent our time researching the darkness that resides within people's hearts. It's
                a graveyard that was sealed by order of Ansem the Wise. The first thing Xemnas did
                once he got rid of him was to undo the seal and build a room in the back. Ever since
                then, he holds himself up in that room when he can, and he talks to someone.</sp>

                dragons, and transformed it into what you call a Heartless. It is my belief that
                this young man came to warn me of that danger. Then, I could alert and prepare my

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> What's so special about one rose, anyway?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Cogsworth</speaker> If the master can love and be loved in return, the

                <speaker>Donald</speaker> Yeah. You told us.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Lumiere</speaker> But there is a time limit. He must find his true love
                before the last petal falls from that rose.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Cogsworth</speaker> Ah, but that is not all... Over time, caring for that
                rose has become a cherished part of the master's daily life.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mrs. Potts</speaker> It's as though all his hopes and dreams are tied to
                that single bloom...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Poor Beast! Then we have to get it back.</sp>

        <sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> We can't without the Beast, though. If it's that important
                to him, he's got to do it himself.</sp>

                gave us all courage. Hmph, maybe you should have kept some for yourself. I mean, are
                you really gonna throw your happiness away? The rose is your only hope, isn't it?
                Well, it's the only hope for Cogsworth and the others, too. So, don't throw away
                your last chance. Remember what it was like before Belle lived here?</sp>

                to go with him, but he insisted I stay here. I can't just sit and wait! I've got to
                know if he's all right.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> A pirate must have a keen eye. Else he won't be
                sailin' free for very long. Savvy?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> Huh? What's that?</sp>

        <sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Elizabeth</speaker> Jack, what happened? This is horrible!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> Ah, but who's to blame for it, eh?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Will</speaker> Well, it certainly isn't Elizabeth.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> It's Organization XIII. They're the ones behind it all.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Wonder where they went.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Will</speaker> The hooded man took the pirates and his creatures with him
                into some strange hole. We saw them leave from inside the captain's stateroom.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> Didn't occur to you to fight them, mate?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Will</speaker> I'm no fool. I knew I was no match for them.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> That I believe.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Will</speaker> Sora, I think we'll need your help.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Got it.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Will</speaker> First, let's find all the medallions. Otherwise, the curse
                can't be broken and the creatures will remain invincible.</sp>

        <cutscene type='' cutNum='' location=''>
                <desc>They set a course for Isla de Muerta. They find the final three Nobodies and
                        take back the medallions. They then return to the ship</desc>
        </cutscene>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> That's four medallions! We got 'em all!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> But where's the chest?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Will</speaker> If we find the hooded man, we'll find it.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Prob'ly in Port Royal.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Elizabeth</speaker> Why's that?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Organization XIII is after people's hearts. So they're gonna
                go where there's lots of people.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Will</speaker> They'll hurt the townsfolk?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> No, they're bringin' 'em flowers, mate. I don't know
                who these Organizers are, but I will say they're makin' we pirates look like proper
                gents.</sp>

        <sp>

                they release Heartless into different worlds. We defeat those Heartless. Then they
                get the hearts. We're never gonna stop 'em like this.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> Sailin' these waters, I've heard some tales, but not
                a one like this.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Will</speaker> Is there any way we can help?</sp>

        <sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> There is.</sp>

        <cutscene type='' cutNum='' location=''>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> It's certain we don't need the likes of that hooded
                fellow and the Heartless about. They'll ruin the market for us true pirates.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Elizabeth</speaker> So that's why you went to Port Royal. And we thought
                you actually wanted to save everyone.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> A pirate always looks to profit, Miss Swann.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Too bad. You had us going there, thinking you'd turned over
                a new leaf.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> The question is, what's beyond the leaf? Savvy?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Elizabeth</speaker> Oh...oh, yes---a reward. And what'll it be?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> That lovely blade of Sora's.</sp>

        <sp>

        <cutscene type='' cutNum='' location=''>
                <desc>Jack, slightly hesitant, takes the Keyblade and holds it up. The blade

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Well, you've always got the Pearl, Jack.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack Sparrow</speaker> That I do. But someday, I'll gather a blood-thirsty
                crew, and come to take that blade. Chance by then I'll have the way to wield it. And
                if I succeed, I'll ask you two to join me. That'd be reward enough.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Elizabeth</speaker> Done.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Maybe someday, Jack'll be able to use the Keyblade after
                all.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> Why's that?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Panic</speaker> And if you win, you'll get lots of fabulous prizes!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Pain</speaker> There are a bunch of tournaments, so make sure you check
                back often.</sp>

                <speaker>Hades</speaker> That's it! This game is over. I've played by the rules so
                far. Okay, I confess! I was hoping Wonderboy would lose, but it was still a fair
                fight. C'mon, is that really so wrong? Huh?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> You can't keep shady stuff secret for long.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Peddler</speaker> So true. I had just snuck into the Palace to, er, borrow
                some treasure when I heard this...voice. It said <q>Release me, and I will give you
                        an even greater reward.</q>
                <q>Who are you?</q> I asked. The voice spoke again. <q>The true Sultan of
                        Agrabah,</q> he said. <q>Imprisoned by villains.</q> Oh! Why did I believe
                such a tall, tall tale? Perhaps I was under Jafar's spell. Yes! That must be
                it!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> And I'm sure the treasure had nothing to do with it,
                right?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Peddler</speaker> Maybe a bit. But Jafar, he never gave me a thing...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> So where did you get all your treasure?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Peddler</speaker> Why, the man in the black coat, of course.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Organization XIII!? I KNEW it!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Peddler</speaker> The treasure was a gift, so I would tell no one about
                Jafar's return. He said he would destroy Jafar after turning him into
                        a...<q>Heartless.</q> So there was no need to upset Agrabah.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> And you bought that?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Peddler</speaker> I'm a merchant. And a good one, at that. I'll buy
                anything if the price is right. It would have been a successful transaction if I
                hadn't been seen...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> You got it!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Aladdin</speaker> Well, you've done it again, Sora. Don't forget about us,

                <desc>He places his hands on Sora's shoulders as magic falls everywhere. In his lab,
                        Dr. Finkelstein is still working on his latest creation. He pulls the switch
                        and the lab table erupts with electricity. It swirls around inside his
                        robot, but the machine just sits there. The doctor spins around in his

                <desc>He rolls over to the desk, where the familiar heart-shaped container is

                        suddenly when something attacks him. Sora, Donald, and Goofy arrive in the

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack</speaker> Of course! And I also have a wonderful idea. If we catch the

        <sp>

                <speaker>Santa <desc>walking up to it</desc>

                is something only I can do, I can give you an idea of what it's like.</sp>

        <sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sally</speaker> Maybe because...presents are a way to give your heart to
                someone special.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Hmm...when you put it that way, I feel sort of bad for

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack</speaker> I don't understand. There's no box! No ribbon tied in a
                bow!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Jack, it's not about the box or the ribbons. It's about
                what's inside the box!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sally</speaker> No, Sora. What really counts---what's really special---is
                the act of giving the gift. To wish deep in your heart to make someone else
                happy.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Jack</speaker> Right...of course! Thank you, Sally, you're absolutely

        <sp>

                <speaker>Lioness</speaker> An omen like that could only be foretelling the end of
                our pride. Yet... King Simba won't do a thing. I guess just being the son of the
                great King Mufasa doesn't necessarily mean he's ready to rule the kingdom
                himself.</sp>

                means the important thing is what you're gonna do being the king. Not what your
                father woulda done.</sp>

                your turn. Remember what I taught ya. <q>You gotta put the past behind you.</q> It's
                time to go out there and show everybody things are gonna be just fine!</sp>

        <sp>

                <speaker>Simba</speaker> Live for today... And find my own path... not my
                father's...</sp>

        <sp>

                <speaker>Simba</speaker> Let's go see Rafiki first. I'm sure he'll be able to tell

        <sp>
                <speaker>Simba</speaker> I think so.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Can you tell us about Scar's ghost?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Rafiki</speaker> Oh, yes...the ghost. A being with no body. It is created
                when the evil heart of Scar meets the hesitating heart of Simba.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Simba</speaker> Hesitating?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Rafiki</speaker> Ohhhh... You thought you were not?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Gawrsh, that ghost sounds just like a Heartless.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Hmm, I don't know.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Rafiki</speaker> You're right, you don't. But you do know it is upsetting.
                And it is upsetting the hearts of everybody in the Pride Lands. You may not know
                what it is, but it still IS. This world, it is full of many such things. And these
                things, a king must face. It is the test that has been set for you, Simba.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Simba</speaker> That's all? Come on. You have to tell us more about the
                ghost...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Rafiki</speaker> No, not today! But the hyenas in the elephant graveyard
                may know more. Does not matter, though. There is little the Simba of late can
                do.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Aw, don't say that! Not when he's ready to try!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Rafiki</speaker> In his head, perhaps...but what about his heart?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Simba</speaker> Forget it, Sora. Let's head for the elephant

        <sp>

                <speaker>Rafiki</speaker> Oh ho ho! He ran away! I knew it would not be easy for

                what to do, not what others think of him.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Why didn't you just say so?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> But where's Simba now?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Timon</speaker> Hey, I know! He's at the oasis. It's our favorite

                <speaker>Pumbaa</speaker> I'll lead the way!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Timon</speaker> Oh, no you won't! Simba'll smell you coming a mile away.
                And if he's smart, he'll run for the hills!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Pumbaa</speaker> Oh...right.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> But Simba... That's not what you're supposed to be. You
                can't be Mufasa. You can only be you. Everybody believes in you as a king. They just
                want to see what you'll do. And if anyone's saying they liked your father better,
                it's because you haven't done much yet. That's all.</sp>

                what's best for me. But my father always had Scar lurking behind his back, trying to
                cut him down. I've got to make the most of my blessings, and rebuild this

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> I don't know... But I think, as long as the Keyblade stays
                with me... I'll have to keep fighting.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Rafiki</speaker> Ahh... The struggle never ends. That is the great Circle
                of Life.</sp>

                <speaker>Leon</speaker> Then I have a favor to ask. When you find Tron, could you
                tell him to come to the I/O tower? That's where we'll upload the MCP Eradication
                program.</sp>

                putting together a program that can de-rezz the MCP. Once we pick it up at the I/O

        <sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> What happened?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Hayner</speaker> We came here looking for Kairi. Then those white things
                attacked us...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Donald</speaker> You gotta be careful!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Yeah, you guys didn't have to go and do that.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Hayner</speaker> Of course we did. Kairi's our friend, too, ya know.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> You're right... You know, I never thought of it like that
                before.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Hayner</speaker> Word is, this mansion gets a lot of really strange
                visitors.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Olette</speaker> We thought this place might be the gateway to some kind of
                alternate Twilight Town.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> What do you mean, alternate Twilight Town?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Pence</speaker> Hey, Goofy, do you think we could see that crystal of
                yours?</sp>

        <cutscene type='' cutNum='' location=''>
                <desc>Goofy nods and takes out the crystal and the munny pouch</desc>
        </cutscene>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Olette</speaker> I made that pouch myself, and I still have it. So there
                shouldn't be two of them here.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Hayner <desc>holding up the Four Crystal Trophy</desc>
                </speaker> And this is the trophy Seifer gave you. You left it behind,
                remember?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Pence</speaker> It's the only one of its kind. Same for the crystals---red,
                blue, yellow, green---only one of each color. But you've got your own!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Hayner</speaker> So...where'd you get it?</sp>

        <cutscene type='' cutNum='' location=''>
                <desc>Sora thinks</desc>
        </cutscene>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> The pouch is from the King. When he gave us munny for the
                train ride, he gave us the crystal too.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Pence</speaker> But then...where did the KING get it?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Hayner</speaker> See? There's gotta be another town out there like this
                one. That would explain how the King got that pouch and the crystal. Everything
                makes sense.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Pence</speaker> That other town must be where whatever's missing from here
                went!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Olette</speaker> Like Kairi.</sp>

                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> I got somethin' to tell ya. I found out where Ansem
                is---Ansem the Wise! The real Ansem! He snuck into Organization XIII's
                stronghold.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> And we've figured out where Kairi is! I'm pretty sure we're
                right.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> But why'd you all come here?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Someone gave us a clue.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> Who?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Goofy</speaker> Well, Your Majesty, Sora thinks it might been Riku.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> It's just a feeling I had.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> Well, if that's what ya think, then it's probably
                right.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> You mean Riku's okay!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> If that's what ya think...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> It's not for me to say.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> But Your Majesty! Why?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> I don't wanna break my promise.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> You made a promise to Riku!? So he's okay! I can see him

        <sp>
                <speaker>Olette</speaker> Your Majesty? You got the pouch with the crystal from
                Riku, didn't you? And you promised not to tell, right?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> Gosh, guys...</sp>

        <sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> It might be. And there should be a way into the Realm of
                Darkness there.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Sora</speaker> Riku told you that, didn't he!?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> Please, Sora. I made a promise.</sp>

                <speaker>Xigbar</speaker> The house is looking pretty empty, huh? I thought I'd get
                a little enjoyment watching Axel throw one last tantrum, but he went a lot quieter
                than I thought.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Luxord</speaker> Perhaps he was ready for it. Perhaps he put his existence
                on the line and won what he'd been longing for.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Xigbar</speaker> Wait a minute. How would that even be possible? We don't
                exist, remember? What you're saying goes against the laws of nature.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Luxord</speaker> Then perhaps he bet his NON-existence. Either way, he came
                out a winner. Oh, Axel. A grifter to the end.</sp>

                <speaker>Saïx</speaker> That's absurd. He won nothing and is nothing. He couldn't
                stand the emptiness of being without a heart, and that led to his demise. He was
                foolish and weak.</sp>

                touched Sora's heart. Perhaps HE will soon awaken.</sp>

                        the sky. Sora, Donald, and Goofy run to see what he's looking at, a giant
                        flying fortress almost covering a heart-shaped moon. It seems a haunting

                <desc>He runs at Sora, scraping the Keyblades on the ground with a screech, sending
                        up sparks. He attacks Sora, but Sora dodges. Sora blocks the Oblivion with
                        his Keyblade, and knocks it away. The Oathkeeper strikes upward, but is also
                        parried. Downward again, more blocking from Sora. The figure jumps into the
                        air, spins and lands on his feet. He jumps at Sora, who leaps to dodge. Sora
                        is hit by the Oblivion and thrown up in the air. The cloaked man jumps up
                        towards him. Sora flips upside down and blocks both Keyblades, then flies to
                        his feet on the floor. The figure hover above and notices the tiles on the

                        the way for the man to pound continuously on his blocking Keyblade. Sora
                        falls on one knee and his Keyblade is knocked away from him. Sora runs to
                        it, but the man stops him, slamming the Oathkeeper into the floor between
                        Sora and his Keyblade. Sora slides to a stop. The man points at him with the
                        Oblivion. Sora struggles against his anger. He holds his hand out toward the
                        Keyblade, and it disappears from the Oathkeeper's hold</desc>

                        Town, Roxas stands upright. He faces downward and seems lifeless. A hooded
                        figure appears and walks toward him</desc>

                        Roxas, gaining momentum until they're barely visible as letters. The man
                        slams his fist into them and four points of golden light shoot out, forcing
                        Roxas to flinch. He opens his eyes and sees a new golden letter X hovering
                        before him. The silver letters rejoin with the X in their center forming a
                        new word, turning fully golden. Roxas looks up at them</desc>

                of Xehanort, my foremost apprentice. The burden was mine to bear.</sp>

        </cutscene>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Ansem the Wise</speaker> I won't deny there was more. I was...obsessed with
                thoughts of revenge. My apprentices stole everything precious to me---my research,
                and my pride.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> I can't help you with revenge.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Ansem the Wise</speaker> I know. Riku's told me a thousand times.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> Where is he?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Ansem the Wise</speaker> He must be with his friends by now. Riku was a
                great help to me. I found him wandering the darkness, after you and he lost track of
                each other.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> Gosh, we didn't lose each other exactly. Riku left...well,
                'cause Xehanort's Heartless was still inside his heart, troubling him. And he sure
                must've been suffering. But what I don't understand is why he looks like that now,
                when he's still Riku at heart...</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Ansem the Wise</speaker> I am to blame. When I met Riku the first time he
                still had the appearance of a boy. Probably because he had such a strong heart. I
                asked him to find a young man named Roxas from Organization XIII, and bring him to
                me. When I told him it would help Sora awaken from his slumber, Riku left without a
                word. He fought Roxas. And I can only surmise Riku lost that fight. Riku must have
                realized then to fight in the realm of darkness, he would have to immerse himself in
                that same darkness. And when he did...you saw what became of him. When Riku brought
                Roxas back to me, he was introducing himself...as Ansem. If that was what it took to
                awaken his friend, he was ready to live in darkness. Riku was the victim of my
                revenge. ...Oh, how my heart ached. I could only laugh to hide my shame.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> I guess it musta been after that when I saw Riku again. He
                said he wanted to help Sora...but he made me promise--- Promise that Sora wouldn't
                ever find out about what happened to him while he was out in the darkness.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Ansem the Wise</speaker> My friend, the time has come. I must make amends
                to these young people.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Riku</speaker> Xemnas was the one who found Roxas. He could use the
                Keyblade because he was your Nobody. That's why Xemnas brought him into the
                Organization--- But Roxas betrayed them. After that I fought him because I thought
                it would help you wake up. I lost, but the next time we met I made sure I was the

                        up and runs toward him with the Keyblade. Riku sends a Dark Firaga spell at
                        Roxas, who blasts through it and continues his attack. He dodges

                        in midair. Ansem is garbed in the same black cloak. He vanishes suddenly,
                        surprising Roxas. Ansem reappears just a foot away. The Guardian's large
                        muscular arm reaches out and grabs him by the chest. Fear laces the boy's
                        face and he struggles to free himself as the arm lifts him into the air. His
                        legs hang aimlessly and his movement is futile. He drops his Keyblades and
                        they disappear after clanging to the ground. Roxas stops moving</desc>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Ansem the Wise</speaker> I'm a fool. I've spent years studying the workings
                of the heart. Yet it seems I still haven't learned a thing!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> What d'ya mean?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Ansem the Wise</speaker> The process of encoding hearts is incalculable.
                The inhabitants of my Twilight Town were data created from real hearts. I was
                convinced that they would think and behave the way I had envisioned---but I couldn't
                have been more wrong. A heart is so much more than any system. I saw it when Roxas
                and Kairi crossed paths. I knew. But I was too stubborn to accept it. It's always
                the same. I try to wrap my mind around things my heart already knows, only to fail.
                While I was trying to bring Sora back, I had so many plans in store. But once Sora
                was an acting force, they fell apart. All my research amounted to nothing, compared
                with that one boy's heart.</sp>

                by data. Run, my friend! It's going to self-destruct, and anything could
                happen!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Xemnas</speaker> I was wondering who would dare interfere with my Kingdom
                Hearts. And look---here you all are. How convenient for me. Ansem the Wise... You
                look pathetic.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Ansem the Wise</speaker> Have your laugh. I deserve as much for failing to
                see you for the fool you are.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Xemnas</speaker> Students do take after their teachers. Only a fool would
                be your apprentice. After all, none of this would have happened without you. YOU are
                the source of all Heartless. It was your research that inspired me to go further
                than you ever dared.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Ansem the Wise</speaker> I admit...my disregard brought chaos to more
                worlds than one. But what were YOU seeking? You erased me from the world, only to
                take my name and continue research better left forgotten... Is this the answer
                you've been looking for?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Xemnas</speaker> All that and more. I'm carrying on what you yourself
                began, and I'm creating a brand new world, one heart at a time. I thought you'd
                praise me, but all you ever do is hold me back. I understand, though. Unlike me, you
                have a heart. And you're powerless to control it. Consumed, by the jealousy you feel
                toward the student who surpassed you.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Ansem the Wise</speaker> Xehanort. Foolish apprentice of a foolish man. You
                have surpassed nothing---only proved how little we both know. We may profess to know
                the heart, but its essence is beyond our reach. We're both ignorant---as oblivious
                as when we began. I'm afraid that any world you try to create... Any world of
                yours...would be an empire of ignorance. That is why you and your creation are
                destined to fall!</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Mickey</speaker> Aw, we don't hate it. It's just kinda...scary. But the
                world's made of light AND darkness. You can't have one without the other, 'cause
                darkness is half of everything. Sorta makes ya wonder why we are scared of the
                dark.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Riku</speaker> It's because of who's lurking inside it.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Xemnas</speaker> Then allow me another question. You accept darkness, yet
                choose to live in the light. So why is it that you loathe us who teeter on the edge
                of nothing? We who were turned away by both light and dark---never given a
                choice?</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Riku</speaker> That's simple. It's because you mess up our worlds.</sp>

        <sp>
                <speaker>Xemnas</speaker> That may be... However, what other choice might we have
                had?</sp>

                what misery befalls the worlds. No matter what you think, what you feel, or how you
                exist.</sp>

                        the barrier disappears. Xemnas's hands coarse with blue lightning. Sora
                        jumps to the top of the entrance and runs up the building. Xemnas jumps up,
                        flips downward, and conjures two red beam swords. He flies down the tower
                        and meets Sora on the giant video screen. Sora slams Xemnas into the

                        ground. The platform they're standing on rises up to the mecha's level.
                        Several buildings fly through the air toward them. Sora jumps up and breaks
                        some of them apart with the Keyblade. He runs across the top of them and
                        slices through. The last one sends them into the cylinder of the flying
                        mecha. Nobodies appear, which they send into the core of the cylinder. They
                        jump onto the side pipes, dodging the large wave of energy which erupts from
                        the cylinder. They jump to the other cylinder and slide across the grate.

                        erupts into a surge of energy. They dodge and reach the other cylinder in
                        time. They dodge the explosion and the cylinder drops off the mecha. As the

                        nuzzle each other until Rafiki walks through with a baby girl. He holds it
                        up on the edge of Pride Rock to the ray of sunlight beaming down from the
                        clouds. The Pride Lands are now lush and green. In the Radiant Garden, Cid
                        is typing at his computer until Yuffie brings him a Sea-Salt Ice Cream bar.
                        Yuna, Rikku, and Paine fly in and Rikku steals Yuffie's ice cream bar. She
                        chases after the three fairies. Leon receives a letter and a magical image
                        of a butterfly floats out. At the cliffs, Aerith looks to the sky. Sora
                        walks into the Secret Place. The light shines down through the holes in the
                        ceiling. He looks around at the cave drawings until coming to his old one of
                        him giving a paopu fruit to Kairi. The picture is changed. Kairi has given
                        one to him as well. Later, Sora meets Riku at the paopu tree overlooking the
                        water</desc>

                <desc>There seems to be destruction everywhere. An armored figure with a cape stands
                        amidst the devastation. He holds a Keyblade over his shoulder. Two more
                        people in armor approach. They walk to a middleground where Sora, Mickey,
                        and Riku's Keyblades are stuck in the ground. The destruction behind them
                        melts away like sand. The three each take a Keyblade. Surrounding them on
                        all sides, creating a four-way path, is an uncountable number of Keyblades.
                        Through the dust, they see another figure walking toward them. Words appear

        <cutscene type='' cutNum='' location=''>
                <desc>An elderly man walks toward three armored figures standing at a crossroads
                        between fields of fallen Keyblades. The wind blows through their capes as
                        they stand, their Keyblades at the ready. The old man stares at them through
                        piercing orange eyes as his form shimmers. A blurred copy of him phases out
                        from his body, flashing into the form of a young man with a black helmet
                        wearing a sinewy skintight suit. The youngest armored wielder moves to start
                        running, but the older man holds him back and runs ahead. The old man and
                        his enigmatic companion stop, and he raises his arm just as the young man
                        leaps toward him. A pillar of earth slams upward into him, toppling him to
                        the ground. He looks up as a taller pillar shoots up in front of him,
                        carrying the old man and his companion. The younger one with the helmet
                        leaps off the pillar, casting an electrical spell down to the armored man.
                        Bolts of lightning strike the ground around him, creating cracks in the
                        armor, as another pillar of earth arises behind him and the young man lands
                        before him. The armored woman rushes ahead of him and he glances up at the
                        old man for a moment, before running forward. The old man cackles, motioning
                        with his hand and the clouds grow dimmer above him. A huge whirlwind erupts
                        from the ground, sending Keyblades spiraling into the air. The armored boy
                        fights the young man in the helmet, their Keyblades clashing against one
                        another. The boy swipes downward, but the other dodges back, summoning an
                        ice spell, which is countered by a second ice spell aimed at him. The
                        armored woman looks up, seeing the whirlwind of Keyblades, which dips toward
                        her. The helmeted one runs alongside it and leaps aboard, sending more ice
                        spells toward the armored woman and armored boy. The dark helmet leaps off
                        as the Keyblades knock the boy over, and he continues releasing ice spells.
                        The boy attacks the helmeted one, who knocks him back as the woman summons a
                        lightning spell. The dark helmet leaps off the ground as the lightning
                        courses over the earth and lands back on the swirling mass of Keyblades,
                        riding it up into the air, slamming the armored man over. The woman watches
                        as the man tumbles over the cliff, righting himself before thrusting his
                        Keyblade into the side to slow his descent. The Keyblades continue to
                        destroy the landscape, knocking the cliff- side over, causing the man to
                        dangle. The earth buckles under the woman as the Keyblades shoot out of the
                        ground, sending her flying and dropping her Keyblade. The swirling mass of
                        blades continues forward, striking the man and forcing him through the rock.
                        As the woman hits the ground, the boy rushes over to her, her helmet knocked
                        off, revealing her blue hair. She grabs her Keyblade and aims it upward,
                        sending a spell towards the man. It reaches him, sparking a blue hexagonal
                        barrier around him, sending the Keyblades scattering. Another torrent of
                        blades slams into the barrier, sending it skyward near the old man, before
                        it freezes in place, ripples coursing through it. The barrier explodes, but
                        the old man stares unblinking. The woman catches her breath as the Keyblade
                        mass topples, sending the man to the ground. He stands haphazardly, making
                        his way toward the old man, who whirls around and blocks his attack with his
                        own Keyblade. He sends an ice spell toward the man, which knocks him back
                        and crawls up his arm. The boy strikes from behind, but the old man
                        teleports, grabbing the boy from behind. The old man smirks as the boy
                        struggles, helplessly flailing his arms as the old man starts to crush his
                        helmet in front of the armored man. The man attempts to move forward, but is
                        flung back by another torrent of Keyblades as the helmeted one rejoins the
                        old man. The woman looks up, seeing the boy, as his helmet is torn off. He
                        gazes back at her as his body is riddled with dark flames before being
                        frozen in ice. The old man casually tosses the boy over the cliff, breaking
                        his Keyblade as he tumbles down, his helmet finally cracking apart. The
                        woman leaps under and catches him as he hits the ground. She gazes down at
                        the frozen youth's blue eyes and blond hair. The old man's Keyblade becomes
                        a blue and pink orb. He smiles and lifts it skyward, sending it into the
                        clouds. The gray clouds begin parting as a blue light spills out of them.
                        The woman watches from below as a large blue heart-shaped moon appears in
