				<p>Our Texts that we have gathered are the game scripts of each of the main titles of Kingdom Hearts. 1, 2, and 3. The first game was released in 2002 <br>and the second installment was released in 2005. After this fans had to wait 14 years to the release of the 3 main installment of the Kingdom hearts franchise in 2019.<br> We chose the main titles are the third game was released so far apart from the first two. This could lead differences in story telling. Causing some characters to become<br> more or less important because of how long inbetween games it was. </p>
				<p>
					We ended up analyzing nouns used as a comparrison between KH1 and the 3 main titles together in order to analyze differences between the first titles and the series as a whole. We also made svg graphs
