		<p>All in all, I think the work we did in the fall semester of 2021 was a lot better than what it was when this project started in the spring semester of 2021. We were able to fix two of <br/>the three original game scripts in order to make sure that the cutscenes were in the proper order and that they were the proper quantity. We also were able to add new attributes to the <br/>cutscene elements in our XML to decifer which wolrd location the cutscene takes place in, as well as what type of cutscene it was. This helped us tremendously as now it gave us <br/>something new to analyze after we had completed marking up the documents. Marking them up did prove to be a very time consuming task since we had to go through hours worth <br/>of gameplay and cutscene cinematic footage on youtube, but once the documents were fully marked up, the feeling was so rewarding.</p> 
		
		<p>As for an analysis of the data, I think the data we got is pretty cool. We were able to make PHP files that call to the scripts and you can physically see what text is held within a <br/>specific cutscene location and number. This is versitile for both games and gives viewers and readers the experience they want when they come to this site. Our network graph is <br/>also pretty amazing. It shows the relation between cutscenes, characters, and locations. It pulls all of the characters from a cutscene and counts how many times they speak as well as <br/>what type of cutscene it is. Then it colors the lines based on the type of cutscene and changes the thickness of that line based on the number of times that character spoke in that <br/>cutscene. Finally it changes the shape of the location orbs based on how many people speak in those specific areas. The final graph we made is a corellation between the Gameplay <br/>cutscenes and Normal cutscenes in the first two games. You can read more about it on the visualization page, but this graph is significant because it gives us the idea that by the time <br/>they released Kingdom Hearts 2, there was a change in mindset. They decided they wanted to make more of a shift to cinematic cutscenes over the cutscenes containing on-screen <br/>text. But this does make sense for the time since the first game came out several years before the second game.</p>
		
		<p>All in all, conclusion wise I think this project went very smoothly this semester, but there is still a lot of work to be done. There is still another complete document that needs <br/>fixing based on our new markup and possibly an eventual fourth game to come.
