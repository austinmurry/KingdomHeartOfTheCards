	<p>Above is the html output of the XQuery code that Austin created in Exide. The purpose of his code is to pull data on each cutscene in the game scripts and <br>output it into a clean format. This code takes the game title and the cutscene location and then finds all of the cutscenes in which that location is found, then <br>outputs the cutscene numbers for which that cutscene location occurs. This is important because it is the basis for what we want our 3D image to revolve <br>around. This helps us know what locations correlate to what cutscene numbers and then we can ultimately pull the data from those cutscenes and output <br>them into a readable format.</p>

		<p> Below is the html output of the XQuery code that Cameron created in Exide. His code dives into the whole collection of the Kingdom Hearts scripts and <br>pulls out all of the distinct characters found throughout the three main games. This could be useful if we decided that we wanted to make a glossary of all of <br>the characters found throughout the three main games and they are already put into alphabetical order for us.
