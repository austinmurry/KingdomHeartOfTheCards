		<p>For our DIGIT 400 project, Austin decided to come back to this project from the Spring 2021 semester and try to fix the mistakes they made last tiem around. He is now <br>joined by a new teammate, Cameron Bigi, who was willing and happy to help him fix the code that had been written before. Our first objective was to rearrange and fix <br>the way the original script documents were coded the first time around. This meant that the two had to go through the old code and properly break the cutscenes up into <br>the correct amount and content. They scrubbed through hours of footage on Youtube of the original cutscenes in order to fix the broken code they had before. 
		</p>
		<p>The next objective was to improve and update the website that was created by the last team. We divided the work from the last team and our new team as to differentiate <br>what was old and what was new. We also want to add a 3D model of the game map and make it so that when you click on a world it will take you to a new page that has <br>a list of all of the cutscenes found in that world as well as the number cutscene it is and what game it is from. You can then click on that cutscene and it will pull up a text <br>document of what is found in that cutscene (descriptions, characters, what they say, etc.).
		</p>
		<p>So far we have been dilligently working to get the cutscenes structured properly and we have even made a few XQuery models as sort of an introductory work into what <br>will later be our bigger goal. These models can be found on the Fall 2021 Visualizations and Analysis page found above.

	<p>When we started, our group wanted to take a look into the three main titles of the Kingdom Hearts franchise. Admittedly at first we didn't exactly know what we wanted <br>to do with the game scripts that we had found for the three games. Our first goal was to break up the scripts into cutscenes, descriptions of the scenes, and the individual <br>speakers that spoke throughout these cutscenes. We used a method of Regexing to try and block all of these out, but since we didn't have a clear structure, the regex that <br>we performed resulted in a cutscene tag opening in front of a description tag and then closing right before a new description tag started. This resulted in a mess of code <br>and way too many cutscenes to handle, but we decided to keep moving forward with this error due to time constraints and needing to meet deadlines.
	  </p>
  	
  	<p>The results of the original teams first go at this project came out to be not very helpful and slightly inconclusive. We were able to get some graphs made that pulled some <br>good information such as the nouns most used throughout the three game titles and we were able to pull what characters interacted the most with other characters. This <br>information did prove to be useful, but we were not sure if this data that we gathered was reliable based on our way of coding the original documents. There were things <br>we wished we could have changed but due to time could not, so we encourage anyone who wishes to work with our original code and clean it up or change it, to please <br>do so with our written permission.</p>
