		<p>For our DIGIT 400 project, Austin decided to come back to this project from the Spring 2021 semester and try to fix the mistakes they made last tiem around. He is now <br>joined by a new teammate, Cameron Bigi, who was willing and happy to help him fix the code that had been written before. Our first objective was to rearrange and fix <br>the way the original script documents were coded the first time around. This meant that the two had to go through the old code and properly break the cutscenes up into <br>the correct amount and content. We scrubbed through hours of footage on Youtube of the original cutscenes in order to fix the broken code we had before. We also want to <br/>add new attributes to the cutscene elements, ones that will add the location that the cutscene takes place in and another to say what type of cutscene it is. We determined <br/>that we want Gameplay cutscenes to resemble those that are not cinematic cutscenes, but are when you have no control over the character and text dialogue appears <br/>on-screen. Normal cutscenes then are those that do have cinematics and have voice acting, no on-screen dialogue.
		</p>
		<p>Our visualization objectives are to create new network graphs that properly show our data from this semester. We can't use any of last semesters work since none of the <br/>data from the XML documents was correct. So We will most certainly make a network graph using cytoscape, but we will see if we can really create any other svg graphs <br/>to represent our data. Our final visualization objective is to create some sort of directory in which the website viewer can click on a cutscene location, and then the website <br/>pull up the list of cutscene numbers associated with that cutscene. Finally, you can then click on the cutscene number and the text contained within that cutscene will <br/>appear on the page so the viewer can read it.
		</p>
		<p>So far we have been dilligently working to get the cutscenes structured properly and we have even made a few XQuery models as sort of an introductory work into what <br>will later be our bigger goal. These models can be found on the Fall 2021 Visualizations page found above.

	<p>When we started, our group wanted to take a look into the three main titles of the Kingdom Hearts franchise. Admittedly at first we didn't exactly know what we wanted <br>to do with the game scripts that we had found for the three games. Our first goal was to break up the scripts into cutscenes, descriptions of the scenes, and the individual <br>speakers that spoke throughout these cutscenes. We used a method of Regexing to try and block all of these out, but since we didn't have a clear structure, the regex that <br>we performed resulted in a cutscene tag opening in front of a description tag and then closing right before a new description tag started. This resulted in a mess of code <br>and way too many cutscenes to handle, but we decided to keep moving forward with this error due to time constraints and needing to meet deadlines.
	  </p>
  	
  	<p>The results of the original teams first go at this project came out to be not very helpful and slightly inconclusive. We were able to get some graphs made that pulled some <br>good information such as the nouns most used throughout the three game titles and we were able to pull what characters interacted the most with other characters. This <br>information did prove to be useful, but we were not sure if this data that we gathered was reliable based on our way of coding the original documents. There were things <br>we wished we could have changed but due to time could not, so we encourage anyone who wishes to work with our original code and clean it up or change it, to please <br>do so with our written permission.</p>
